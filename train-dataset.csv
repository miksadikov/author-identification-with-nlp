id5319,"She signed those lines with her name--pressed them hurriedly over the blotting-pad that lay with the rest of the writing materials on the table--took the note in her hand, after first folding it up--and then, snatching at the bunch of keys, with a look all round her as if she dreaded being secretly observed, left the room.","WKL"

id1148,"Across the middle of it a single sentence had been formed       by the expedient of pasting printed words upon it.","ACD"
id209,"Here is a summary of his record.","ACD"
id3906,"That in itself would be nothing remarkable, but sinister rumours as to Mr. Maltravers’ financial position have been in the air of late, and the Northern Union have ascertained beyond any possible doubt that the deceased gentleman stood upon the verge of bankruptcy.","ACR"

id5194,"Before your grave is dug?","WKL"
id5845,"Of course it is!","WKL"
id1210,"That may point to carelessness or       it may point to agitation and hurry upon the part of the cutter.","ACD"
id1884,"These thoughts helped me to suffer in silence while the blood still trickled over my neck and dripped upon the stone floor.","ACD"
id4258,"She led the way round the house to where tea was spread under the shade of a large sycamore.","ACR"
id3674,"The other diamond, I said, lowering my voice.","ACR"
id6871,"The noise and merriment were at their height when the servant came in, and struck the whole party dumb by the announcement of visitors in the drawing-room.","WKL"
id2413,"We are at a loose end, as it were.","ACR"
id1196,"You can see that it was a very       short-bladed scissors, since the cutter had to take two snips       over ‘keep away.’        That is so.","ACD"
id4137,"Perhaps you could spare me a few minutes in about half an hour’s time?","ACR"

id1776,"It was Etienne!","ACD"
id542,"I was to blame myself.","ACD"
id5371,"Twenty-four years later--in the summer of eighteen hundred and fifty-five--there was a villa at Hampstead to be let, furnished.","WKL"
id6684,"She had written at once to the address indicated on his card, in such terms and to such purpose as would prevent him, she hoped and believed, from ever venturing near the house again.","WKL"
id5528,"Forgive me for speaking my mind bluntly--I say what I think.","WKL"
id6394,"She snatched up an empty plate from the table, to represent a sheet of music, held it before her in the established concert-room position, and produced an imitation of the unfortunate singer’s grimaces and courtesyings, so accurately and quaintly true to the original, that her father roared with laughter; and even the footman (who came in at that moment with the post-bag) rushed out of the room again, and committed the indecorum of echoing his master audibly on the other side of the door.","WKL"
id6840,"Under these unfavorable auspices, Mr. Francis Clare made his appearance the next morning in the grounds at Combe-Raven; and, something doubtful of the reception that might await him, slowly approached the precincts of the house.","WKL"
id6396,"I want the key, said Magdalen, passing from the imitation at the breakfast-table to the post-bag on the sideboard with the easy abruptness which characterized all her actions.","WKL"

id1306,"Au revoir, and good-morning!","ACD"
id5169,"Her old habit of talking to herself began to resume its influence, as she now walked rapidly backward and forward, sometimes along the room and sometimes across it.","WKL"
id1659,"cried a voice, and then I heard a blow and a scream.","ACD"
id1079,"If the devil did desire to       have a hand in the affairs of men—        Then you are yourself inclining to the supernatural       explanation.","ACD"
id2901,"In an upper room of the Mill House the body of a beautiful young woman was discovered yesterday, strangled.","ACR"
id3839,"In this way he will quiet the lady, who might conceivably tell all to her husband, an affair which would not suit our blackmailer at all, he will have ?50,000 insurance money (aha, you had forgotten that!","ACR"

id161,"To ask a favor.","ACD"
id1005,"At ten o’clock tomorrow, Dr. Mortimer, I will       be much obliged to you if you will call upon me here, and it will       be of help to me in my plans for the future if you will bring Sir       Henry Baskerville with you.","ACD"
id3782,"What?","ACR"
id2442,"January, a detestable foggy month!","ACR"
id4226,"I wonder if we’ve time to pick up Cynthia.","ACR"
id570,"Let me hear you reconstruct the man by an       examination of it.","ACD"
id1218,"How in the world can you say that?","ACD"
id4910,"Light!--give me more light.","WKL"
id4191,"Oh, I suppose she was after your time.","ACR"
id1463,"It was over this matter of pictures that I had first met her, for her father owned a palace on the farther side of the Rialto Bridge upon the Grand Canal, and it was so packed with wall-paintings that Suchet sent a party of sappers to cut some of them out and send them to Paris.","ACD"
id5195,"Before your coffin is made?","WKL"
id373,"Following him down the passage I was suddenly interrupted by a small woman, who stepped out from what proved to be the dining-room door.","ACD"

id5080,"Those vile words he spoke of you when you were married will come home to him some day.","WKL"
id3068,"Good morning.","ACR"
id3155,"Is the girl a crook, and are the shadowers detectives preparing to arrest her?","ACR"
id4479,"John Cavendish frowned and changed the subject.","ACR"
id5789,"One of his elbows was on the table, he bit fiercely at his finger-nails.","WKL"
id2690,"I will try to explain as clearly as I can.","ACR"
id1220,"The pen has spluttered       twice in a single word and has run dry three times in a short       address, showing that there was very little ink in the bottle.","ACD"
id2830,"Dead as a door-nail.","ACR"
id87,"And Lady Stanley!","ACD"
id4327,"Everyone dumbfounded.","ACR"
id6265,"Quite right; so it was.","WKL"
id6577,"Walking behind him, his back and shoulders were almost young enough to have passed for five-and-thirty.","WKL"
id129,"Besides, as you say, men ought to MAKE their own chances, and not wait until they are given.","ACD"
id4312,"She smiled.","ACR"
id2292,"Stab me to the heart, dear friend!","ACD"
id461,"What does it prove?","ACD"
id2772,"Anna the Adventuress.","ACR"
id923,"It was all very confused.","ACD"
id5479,"Mr. Vanborough impatiently shook his head.","WKL"
id5747,"But for his residence on the Continent the question of the flaw in his marriage might no doubt have been raised long since.","WKL"

id916,"Yes.","ACD"
id4765,"Well, we might just see.","ACR"
id5053,"Clasping her hands fast together, Sarah regarded her mistress, for the first time, with steady eyes, and spoke to her for the first time in steady tones.","WKL"

id6465,"What does papa mean by being cross with Me?","WKL"
id4386,"Supper is at half-past seven.","ACR"
id3187,"I cried, divided between amusement and annoyance.","ACR"
id6827,"The grasp included the whole correspondence, with one exception—that exception being a final report from the civil engineer, which notified the termination of the connection between his pupil and himself, and the immediate return of Frank to his father’s house.","WKL"
id2513,"She paused, and then added in an indifferent tone of voice: As a matter of fact, he happens to be my husband.","ACR"
id414,"This and a bellowing, roaring, rumbling voice made up my first impression of the notorious Professor Challenger.","ACD"
id6663,"Leaving a message with the servant requesting Norah to make the tea that morning, she went upstairs at once to the solitude and security of her own room.","WKL"
id633,"I read his record aloud.","ACD"
id2394,"My position is not what it was.","ACR"
id3149,"Deduce, Poirot, from the following facts!","ACR"
id5173,"She arranged and re-arranged the cheap china ornaments on her chimney-piece a dozen times over--put her pin-cushion first on the looking-glass, then on the table in front of it--changed the position of the little porcelain dish and tray on her wash-hand-stand, now to one side of the basin, and now to the other.","WKL"
id4832,"Can't you tell, by the sound, which is which of those bells yet?","WKL"
id4185,"John noticed my surprise at the news of his mother’s remarriage and smiled rather ruefully.","ACR"
id3083,"Done it myself.","ACR"
id3637,"In his haste it caught in the door, I explained.","ACR"
id2828,"The thing wasn’t real—couldn’t be.","ACR"
id5674,"Yes.","WKL"

id519,"He sprang to his feet, waving his fists and wheezing like an asthmatic.","ACD"
id3865,"That is all she cares for, that one!","ACR"
id4065,"Then I saw this bad news in the paper and I came down to see if there was anything I could do.","ACR"
id507,"I cried.","ACD"
id3972,"And, turning, the doctor slammed the door sharply in our faces.","ACR"
id6273,"Neither hair nor head-dress was out of harmony with her face—it looked older than her years: the hard handwriting of trouble had scored it heavily at some past time.","WKL"
id4323,"He was a funny little man, a great dandy, but wonderfully clever.","ACR"

id241,"Employers' Liability Act, you know.","ACD"
id145,"And, after all, this opening chapter will seem to the reader to have nothing to do with my narrative; and yet there would have been no narrative without it, for it is only when a man goes out into the world with the thought that there are heroisms all round him, and with the desire all alive in his heart to follow any which may come within sight of him, that he breaks away as I did from the life he knows, and ventures forth into the wonderful mystic twilight land where lie the great adventures and the great rewards.","ACD"
id1562,"I wished to look round for some mode of escape, and in doing so I gave an almost imperceptible movement of my head.","ACD"
id3820,"To begin with, Lady Yardly was getting restive.","ACR"
id298,"Half an hour later I was seated in the newspaper office with a huge tome in front of me, which had been opened at the article Weissmann versus Darwin, with the sub heading, Spirited Protest at Vienna.","ACD"

id3450,"um, um, um, .","ACR"
id3813,"There was only _one_ diamond, my friend!","ACR"
id6848,"He was undeniably handsome, graceful, well-bred—but no close observer could look at him without suspecting that the stout old family stock had begun to wear out in the later generations, and that Mr. Francis Clare had more in him of the shadow of his ancestors than of the substance.","WKL"
id6688,"Far different was the impression produced on her when she advanced to the second half, and when she had read it to the end.","WKL"
id6468,"retorted Miss Garth.","WKL"

id3098,"The inspector fell in with the suggestion readily enough.","ACR"
id788,"It is a short account of the facts elicited at the death of       Sir Charles Baskerville which occurred a few days before that       date.","ACD"
id2549,"I could easily have written them myself, and the probabilities were that Papa would never have learnt of the transaction, not being a reader of the _Daily Budget._ However, I rejected this course as being too risky, so I merely put on my best hat and went sadly down the village to interview our justly irate grocer.","ACR"
id5542,"Is _that_ a wife who can help me to make my place in society?--who can smooth my way through social obstacles and political obstacles, to the House of Lords?","WKL"
id5258,"She turned down a side walk, which led to a terrace and overlooked the church of the neighboring village.","WKL"
id610,"Well, then, supposing that ‘C.C.H.’ does stand for ‘Charing       Cross Hospital,’ what further inferences may we draw?","ACD"

id1025,"I knew that seclusion and solitude were very necessary for my       friend in those hours of intense mental concentration during       which he weighed every particle of evidence, constructed       alternative theories, balanced one against the other, and made up       his mind as to which points were essential and which immaterial.","ACD"
id745,"But the young maiden,             being discreet and of good repute, would ever avoid him,             for she feared his evil name.","ACD"

id6423,"and how you will wish there were no such things as letters in the world!","WKL"
id1888,"She lies very still and she has never opened her mouth, said another.","ACD"
id949,"I have cross-examined these men,       one of them a hard-headed countryman, one a farrier, and one a       moorland farmer, who all tell the same story of this dreadful       apparition, exactly corresponding to the hell-hound of the       legend.","ACD"

id6833,"Exactly what I predicted, said Mr. Clare.","WKL"

id3723,"At the _Magnificent_, we were ushered at once into the manager’s office.","ACR"
id1642,"I have never been a man of religion, though I have always had a respect for those who were, but I remember that night that the star shining down the shaft seemed to be an all-seeing eye which was upon me, and I felt as a young and frightened recruit might feel in battle when he saw the calm gaze of his colonel turned upon him.","ACD"
id1491,"Here and there, on the bridges which spanned the canal, there was the dim glimmer of an oil lamp, and sometimes there came a gleam from some niche where a candle burned before the image of a saint.","ACD"
id6252,"A quarter past eight, and nothing happened.","WKL"
id4811,"We watched him, fascinated, though I think we all knew in our hearts that it was too late, and that nothing could be done now.","ACR"

id3304,"Surely I said suddenly, there are some very famous jewels in the Yardly collection, a large diamond amongst them?","ACR"
id6898,"cried Magdalen, her clear young voice ringing through the conservatory like a bell; her loose sleeves falling back and showing her round white arms to the dimpled elbows, as she clapped her hands ecstatically in the air.","WKL"
id4688,"Do not trouble, Mary, said Inglethorp.","ACR"
id931,"I       could discern no others.","ACD"
id5549,"Friends who will see her swindling scoundrel of a father (when my back is turned) coming drunk to the door to borrow money of her!","WKL"
id4671,"What was Mary Cavendish’s concern in the matter?","ACR"
id6028,"She looked from him to the paper, and dropped, without a cry to warn him, without an effort to save herself, senseless at his feet.","WKL"

id330,"With your permission, I would ask the favor of an interview, as I feel strongly upon the subject, and have certain suggestions which I could only elaborate in a personal conversation.","ACD"
id2211,"Once a man rose from beside one of the fires and stopped me by seizing my sleeve.","ACD"
id4638,"she said to Lawrence.","ACR"
id5618,"Involved in private and personal troubles, you would have hesitated at asking him to help you.","WKL"
id3106,"The man was frightened.","ACR"
id3185,"I know it well.","ACR"

id3917,"Inquiries at the station yielded the information that Marsdon Manor was about a mile distant.","ACR"
id769,"The moon was shining             bright upon the clearing, and there in the centre lay the             unhappy maid where she had fallen, dead of fear and of             fatigue.","ACD"
id1583,"I shrank back, and in an instant my pursuers were on me.","ACD"
id2931,"Since Mrs. James was positive that there was no one in the house when the lady entered it, and that nobody except the young man in question entered it until the following afternoon, it seemed only logical to conclude that he was the murderer of the unfortunate Mrs. de Castina.","ACR"
id467,"Even at that moment of tension I found time for amazement at the discovery that he was quite a short man, his head not higher than my shoulder--a stunted Hercules whose tremendous vitality had all run to depth, breadth, and brain.","ACD"
id4396,"He looked about forty, very dark with a melancholy clean-shaven face.","ACR"
id6267,"With that expression of opinion, Mr. Vanstone whistled to his vixenish terrier; flourished his stick at the hall door in cheerful defiance of the rain; and set off through wind and weather for his morning walk.","WKL"
id5315,"That engagement forbids      me to destroy this letter, or to take it away with me if I      leave the house.","WKL"
id4970,"There are two doses left.","WKL"
id6212,"His enemies said, derisively, He will be Lord Chancellor in a year or two!","WKL"
id6846,"His gentle, wandering brown eyes would have looked to better advantage in a woman’s face—they wanted spirit and firmness to fit them for the face of a man.","WKL"
id3481,"Let us not confuse the mind.","ACR"
id1885,"It was that sound which nearly led to my destruction.","ACD"
id1511,"Yet I lay quiet, for there is a time to resist and there is a time to save one's strength.","ACD"
id5411,"My daughter is little Anne--as _I_ was.","WKL"
id1123,"Our clients were       punctual to their appointment, for the clock had just struck ten       when Dr. Mortimer was shown up, followed by the young baronet.","ACD"
id4316,"Or Sherlock Holmes?","ACR"
id3451,".","ACR"
id3868,"I suppose it was Rolf who sent her the duplicate letters.","ACR"
id6883,"Mere acquaintances, nothing more.","WKL"
id1257,"That was why I       put them out.","ACD"
id5076,"Will he come back?","WKL"
id4023,"I thank you for all your courtesy, madame.","ACR"
id1372,"You saved my good name, and perhaps       my life.","ACD"
id3090,"A busy medical man very often doesn’t read the papers.","ACR"
id1635,"Through one of these I was thrust and the spring lock closed behind me.","ACD"

id1602,"Not a hand was raised to arrest me until I halted in front of a formidable old man, whose long grey beard and masterful manner told me that both by years and by character he was the man in authority.","ACD"
id1762,"I waited until the steps had died away, and then I cautiously drew aside the two boards and peeped through.","ACD"
id5580,"he asked.","WKL"
id3908,"Maltravers had a beautiful young wife, and it is suggested that he got together all the ready money he could for the purpose of paying the premiums on a life insurance for his wife’s benefit, and then committed suicide.","ACR"
id3507,"This affair of Yardly Chase, is it, as you say, all fixed up between you and Mr. Rolf?","ACR"
id1932,"But the next instant he saw the pallor of my face and the blood which was still pouring from my head.","ACD"
id2462,"Well, I did my part—but I also did one thing which the ‘Colonel’ had not foreseen.","ACR"
id1160,"We will       confine ourselves for the present with your permission to this       very interesting document, which must have been put together and       posted yesterday evening.","ACD"
id2754,"I had no doubt that he was saying to himself, What _has_ the child done to herself?","ACR"
id4218,"As we turned in at the lodge gates, John said:  I’m afraid you’ll find it very quiet down here, Hastings.","ACR"
id695,"The man drew out paper and tobacco and twirled the one up in the       other with surprising dexterity.","ACD"
id5430,"Anne rose at once, and the two girls went away together into the garden, hand in hand.","WKL"
id1443,"As a punishment for these murders a great many more of their pictures were sent away, and the soldiers took to breaking the statues and firing their muskets at the stained-glass windows.","ACD"
id6201,"On a certain day in that year two special items of news appeared in the papers--the news of an elevation to the peerage, and the news of a suicide.","WKL"
id9,"How beautiful she was!","ACD"
id1683,"Resistance was useless.","ACD"
id3818,"I asked, puzzled.","ACR"

id3594,"Round the column of her neck was a rivulet of fire.","ACR"
id5099,"The breeze outside, strengthening just then with the slow advance of the morning, parted the window-curtains a little, and wafted a breath of its sweet fragrance joyously into the sick-room.","WKL"
id1752,"Perhaps your spirit may not be so proud by that time.","ACD"
id3184,"All cannot be as Hercule Poirot!","ACR"
id5305,"As she arrived at that conclusion, she looked up.","WKL"
id6549,"Norah, it is needless to say, had long since ceased to be her pupil; and Magdalen had, by this time, completed her education.","WKL"
id6924,"Oh yes!","WKL"

id1207,"We       may take it, therefore, that the letter was composed by an       educated man who wished to pose as an uneducated one, and his       effort to conceal his own writing suggests that that writing       might be known, or come to be known, by you.","ACD"

id4045,"You did not?","ACR"
id6334,"Her lips had the true feminine delicacy of form, her cheeks the lovely roundness and smoothness of youth—but the mouth was too large and firm, the chin too square and massive for her sex and age.","WKL"
id2900,"The Mill House, which is the property of Sir Eustace Pedler, M.P., is to be let unfurnished, and an order to view this property was found in the pocket of the man who was at first thought to have committed suicide by throwing himself on the live rail at Hyde Park Corner Tube Station.","ACR"

id5168,"When she did look, it was with an effort and a start, with a searching distrust of the empty dimness in the remoter corners of the room.","WKL"
id5986,"She waited--with her back turned on her husband, with her eyes fixed on Lady Jane.","WKL"
id1104,"How can you say that?","ACD"
id5233,"One of these was looped up, and toward the opening thus made Sarah now advanced, after cautiously leaving her candle in the passage outside.","WKL"
id6873,"Norah rose as readily as if the new arrivals had been a relief to her mind.","WKL"
id1002,"And then you will say nothing to him at all until I have made up       my mind about the matter.","ACD"
id3331,"His tone was mocking, but I fancied that an undercurrent of seriousness lay beneath it.","ACR"
id262,"Oh, it was rank nonsense about some queer animals he had discovered.","ACD"
id882,"I don’t suppose I should have done so had I not       known this legend.","ACD"
id4906,"Through the open window, opened to admit the fresh air of the new morning after the sultriness of the August night, there poured monotonously into the room the dull, still, distant roaring of the surf on the sandy coast.","WKL"
id6806,"You ought to be ashamed of yourself for talking of him as you do.","WKL"
id1261,"You see, if I am to be squire down there I must dress the       part, and it may be that I have got a little careless in my ways       out West.","ACD"

id5852,"Will you give me the refusal of it till to-morrow?","WKL"
id6391,"Don’t you remember the faces she made when she sang?","WKL"
id4339,"It might be a ‘she’, I suggested.","ACR"
id630,"As to the latter part, I have no means of checking you, said I,       but at least it is not difficult to find out a few particulars       about the man’s age and professional career.","ACD"
id5935,"said Mrs. Vanborough, your ladyship’s looks are looks of contempt; your ladyship’s words can bear but one interpretation.","WKL"
id2852,"Yes, it smelt strongly of them.","ACR"
id581,"And then again, there is the ‘friends of the C.C.H.’ I should       guess that to be the Something Hunt, the local hunt to whose       members he has possibly given some surgical assistance, and which       has made him a small presentation in return.","ACD"

id6665,"The first part of it referred to Captain Wragge, and entered unreservedly into all necessary explanations relating to the man himself and to the motive which had brought him to Combe-Raven.","WKL"
id6536,"There is the state of things in plain words.","WKL"
id667,"Yes, sir.","ACD"

id992,"At least I might go the length of saying that there is some       evidence that this may be so.","ACD"
id4925,"Having put away the plays, Sarah went back to her mistress; and, with more of dread and bewilderment in her face than grief, opened her lips to speak.","WKL"
id2206,"The house appeared to be an empty one, for I passed through the heart of it and out, by an open door, into the street beyond.","ACD"
id457,"But what does that prove?","ACD"
id7,"All that evening I had felt like the soldier who awaits the signal which will send him on a forlorn hope; hope of victory and fear of repulse alternating in his mind.","ACD"

id4411,"Off?","ACR"
id6697,"The long interval that had elapsed since the birth of her last child; the serious illness which had afflicted her after the death of that child in infancy; the time of life at which she had now arrived—all inclined her to dismiss the idea as soon as it arose in her mind.","WKL"

id1909,"It was the rattle of oars and the buzz of many voices.","ACD"
id3280,"As a rule it’s locked up in my jewel-case, and left in the hotel safe deposit.","ACR"
id2929,"However, as the Tube victim was dead at two o’clock, and the woman was alive and well at three o’clock, the only logical conclusion to come to was that the two occurrences had nothing to do with each other, and that the order to view the house at Marlow found in the dead man’s pocket was merely one of those coincidences which so often occur in this life.","ACR"
id6981,"One of her favored swains next secured Captain Absolute, and another laid violent hands on Sir Lucius O’Trigger.","WKL"
id6304,"As they crossed the hall and entered the breakfast-room, Miss Vanstone was full of the all-absorbing subject of the last night’s concert.","WKL"
id3971,"The cause of death was clear, and in my profession we see no need to distress unduly the relatives of a dead patient.","ACR"
id6686,"Although the statement thus presented implied a weakness in Mrs. Vanstone’s character which Miss Garth, after many years of intimate experience, had never detected, she accepted the explanation as a matter of course; receiving it all the more readily inasmuch as it might, without impropriety, be communicated in substance to appease the irritated curiosity of the two young ladies.","WKL"
id2818,"There was a vivid flash from the rails and a crackling sound.","ACR"

id1277,"And now there’s this affair of the letter to me at the hotel.","ACD"
id1386,"Yes, sir.","ACD"
id3934,"The doctor looked rather surprised.","ACR"
id2248,"Water, water, for Heaven's sake, water!","ACD"
id6817,"Other letters, later in date, described him as a little too ready to despond about himself; as having been sent away, on that account, to some new railway works, to see if change of scene would rouse him; and as having benefited in every respect by the experiment—except perhaps in regard to his professional studies, which still advanced but slowly.","WKL"
id4601,"It is by the charity of that good Mrs. Inglethorp that I am here.","ACR"
id4842,"Observing this, he passed quickly along the passage, and knocked at an old-fashioned oak door at the end of it.","WKL"
id6901,"It all depends on you.","WKL"
id798,"The circumstances connected with the death of Sir Charles             cannot be said to have been entirely cleared up by the             inquest, but at least enough has been done to dispose of             those rumours to which local superstition has given rise.","ACD"
id1794,"The old greybeard?","ACD"
id6240,"It was a wild morning.","WKL"

id982,"Why should he not go to the home of his fathers?","ACD"
id562,"It was just       such a stick as the old-fashioned family practitioner used to       carry—dignified, solid, and reassuring.","ACD"
id4485,"That’s a pretty girl, I remarked appreciatively.","ACR"
id2542,"That seems to show that whereas our ancestors were more Simian than we are, the chimpanzee’s were of a higher type than the present species—in other words, the chimpanzee is a degenerate.","ACR"
id5895,"In speechless amazement Mrs. Vanborough’s eyes followed the direction of Lady Jane’s eyes--and rested on the lawyer, personally a total stranger to her.","WKL"
id4746,"The whole household was aroused by now.","ACR"
id1024,"Then I should be very glad to compare impressions as to       this most interesting problem which has been submitted to us this       morning.","ACD"
id6321,"The hall-clock struck the adjourned breakfast-hour.","WKL"
id487,"But there is a limit.","ACD"
id5739,"Scoundrel as he was--in intention, if not yet in act--the loss of the oldest friend he had in the world staggered him for the moment.","WKL"
id2685,"Your father, as you know, was a very great man.","ACR"
id1263,"It seems a singularly useless thing to steal, said Sherlock       Holmes.","ACD"
id1481,"He was not tall, but he was one of the broadest men that I have ever seen in my life.","ACD"
id3720,"He did so hate failure of any kind.","ACR"
id6843,"His slim figure had now acquired strength and grace, and had increased in stature to the medium height.","WKL"
id6995,"In eight days more the night of performance would arrive; a phalanx of social martyrs two hundred strong had been convened to witness it; three full rehearsals were absolutely necessary; and two characters in the play were not filled yet.","WKL"
id2301,"In an instant I put out my light and slipped behind the window-curtains.","ACD"
id3531,"You return to Yardly Chase at once?","ACR"
id4512,"THE 16TH AND 17TH OF JULY   I had arrived at Styles on the 5th of July.","ACR"
id4905,"Other objects were all merged together in the general obscurity.","WKL"
id5146,"I will wait here until you come back.","WKL"
id5827,"I hope I have not driven her away.","WKL"
id205,"I really know nothing about him, said I.  I only remember his name in connection with the police-court proceedings, for striking Blundell.","ACD"
id2317,"I rushed into the street as the Spaniard had done, eager only to leave that house of gloom behind me, and I had run as far as the cathedral before my wits came back to me.","ACD"
id5193,"she said, her eyes riveted on the curtain while her hand groped over the lock for the key.","WKL"
id3343,"I’ve already said so to Mary.","ACR"
id2996,"What?","ACR"
id3940,"Indeed.","ACR"
id6996,"With this lamentable story, and with the humblest apologies for presuming on a slight acquaintance, the Marrables appeared at Combe-Raven, to appeal to the young ladies for a Lucy, and to the universe for a Falkland, with the mendicant pertinacity of a family in despair.","WKL"
id6186,"They sat on the same bench, and sided with the same party.","WKL"
id1352,"No.","ACD"
id2947,"Good morning, I said nervously.","ACR"
id2236,"It was a voice, a whispering voice, in my very ear.","ACD"
id2272,"Yes.","ACD"
id6249,"Further inquiries, on the part of all the female servants in succession, elicited no additional information of any sort.","WKL"
id709,"I think, Dr. Mortimer, you would       do wisely if without more ado you would kindly tell me plainly       what the exact nature of the problem is in which you demand my       assistance.","ACD"
id6992,"Thanks to these vigorous measures, the play was at last supplied with representatives—always excepting the two unmanageable characters of Lucy the waiting-maid, and Falkland, Julia’s jealous lover.","WKL"
id752,"And while the revellers stood aghast at the fury of             the man, one more wicked or, it may be, more drunken than             the rest, cried out that they should put the hounds upon             her.","ACD"
id6917,"Miss Marrable and I have a turn for business, and we settled it all in five minutes.","WKL"
id6021,"she cried, shrinking from the ghastly face that confronted her with the fixed stare of agony in the great, glittering eyes.","WKL"
id3043,"He looked like a man who’d seen a ghost.","ACR"
id1216,"It is the scientific use of the       imagination, but we have always some material basis on which to       start our speculation.","ACD"
id5970,"I have made a very painful discovery, she said, gravely, to Mr. Vanborough.","WKL"
id1181,"Well, now—so it is!","ACD"
id1627,"Remove him until we have dealt with the others.","ACD"
id4244,"Shall press you in.","ACR"
id3660,"Why?","ACR"
id2322,"I had still two hours in which to act.","ACD"
id4439,"But not now?","ACR"
id1186,"Most certainly.","ACD"
id2854,"I walked home slowly and did a good deal of thinking.","ACR"
id4111,"Then he took from his pocket his big turnip-faced watch and laid it on the table beside him.","ACR"
id6102,"It was a mere figure of speech--in no degree satisfactory to any reasonable mind--to say, as Lady Lundie said, that she had got her death-blow on the day when her husband deserted her.","WKL"
id5586,"You have the right of an old friend.","WKL"
id3628,"But it’s always locked.","ACR"
id4636,"Goodness gracious!","ACR"
id2488,"Killed in the war.","ACR"
id1969,"It was a long journey from Berlin to the Pyrenees.","ACD"
id3201,"You must go to the little Belgian.","ACR"
id1778,"for some minutes, for one does not make speeches at moments like that.","ACD"
id1337,"How else could it be known so quickly that it was the       Northumberland Hotel which he had chosen?","ACD"
id5119,"Sarah put her ear close to them.","WKL"
id2914,"It was situated at some distance from the lodge, and she was not in the habit of accompanying prospective tenants.","ACR"
id3612,"The Chinaman—the side door.","ACR"
id1138,"asked       Holmes, glancing keenly across at our visitor.","ACD"
id6126,"Yes.","WKL"
id5953,"he hesitates!","WKL"
id5376,"Her husband, some years younger than herself, faced her at the table, sitting silent and constrained, and never, even by accident, looking at his wife.","WKL"
id226,"I am not very clear yet why I am to interview this gentleman.","ACD"
id3438,".","ACR"
id6598,"Once more Miss Garth attempted to stem the man’s flow of words.","WKL"
id1251,"Well, mislaid it, anyhow.","ACD"
id2237,"Mon Dieu!","ACD"
id4062,"I got some news from my lawyers that detained me, explained the young man.","ACR"
id4118,"Bernard.","ACR"
id4606,"His head was exactly the shape of an egg, and he always perched it a little on one side.","ACR"
id4475,"And who is Dr. Bauerstein?","ACR"
id2714,"Yes, yes, my dear child.","ACR"
id4416,"She looked excited and determined, and slightly on the defensive.","ACR"
id1975,"Yet we had a powerful artillery, and our engineers were of the best.","ACD"
id6224,"Mr. Delamayn consulted his wife, and took it with a peerage.","WKL"
id2843,"By the time the second lift reached the street level, there was no sign of my quarry.","ACR"
id3733,"He duly signed the receipt, remarking carelessly as he did so: Looks a bit different from my ordinary one, but I hurt my hand getting out of the taxi.","ACR"
id4650,"Mary Cavendish was saying in the voice of a woman desperately controlling herself:  Then you won’t show it to me?","ACR"
id4589,"_Mon ami_ Hastings!","ACR"
id748,"Now, the poor lass upstairs was like to have her             wits turned at the singing and shouting and terrible oaths             which came up to her from below, for they say that the             words used by Hugo Baskerville, when he was in wine, were             such as might blast the man who said them.","ACD"
id5298,"What had she actually bound herself to do?","WKL"
id4487,"That is Mrs. Raikes.","ACR"
id2267,"He was dying as much from thirst as from his wounds, and these inhuman wretches had placed a beaker of wine upon the table in front of him to add a fresh pang to his tortures.","ACD"
id4395,"At the same moment, a man stepped out from the shadow of a tree and walked slowly in the same direction.","ACR"
id5694,"The rising solicitor lifted his eyebrows in polite surprise.","WKL"
id3056,"On an average about five hundred people wrote daily to announce their success in the quest, and tall young men with well-tanned faces cursed the day when their tailors had persuaded them to a brown suit.","ACR"
id2963,"Done it myself.","ACR"
id5825,"What pretty grounds!","WKL"
id1717,"Where are the horses of St. Mark?","ACD"
id402,"There was a tap at a door, a bull's bellow from within, and I was face to face with the Professor.","ACD"
id4652,"Then show it to me.","ACR"
id3399,"Were yours, too, left by hand—by a Chinaman?","ACR"
id5106,"Even while she pronounced these solemn words, even at that last struggle for life and strength, the ineradicable theatrical instinct showed, with a fearful inappropriateness, how firmly it kept its place in her mind.","WKL"
id6984,"All the friends of the family suddenly became unreliable people, for the first time in their lives.","WKL"
id4540,"We were detained under suspicion by the hospital porter, until Cynthia appeared to vouch for us, looking very cool and sweet in her long white overall.","ACR"
id3554,"said Lord Yardly.","ACR"
id5063,"Yes, yes--the Bible the clergyman used, continued Mrs. Treverton, vacantly, after the book had been produced.","WKL"
id1746,"But now the old president glared at me again like a tiger who comes back to his victim.","ACD"
id4649,"As I ran out to the tennis court a few moments later, I had to pass the open boudoir window, and was unable to help overhearing the following scrap of dialogue.","ACR"
id3701,"The diamond of Miss Marvell, it has been stolen.","ACR"
id3305,"That’s so, said Miss Marvell briefly.","ACR"
id3337,"Well, what does Monsieur Poirot say to our little problem?","ACR"
id3484,"Thus we have order, _method_, which, as I have often told you, Hastings——  Exactly, I said hastily, and put the offending volume in its proper place.","ACR"
id5650,"They won’t take long.","WKL"
id3298,"I guess it’s the real old feudal stuff all right.","ACR"
id5861,"She smiled satirically, and summoned her friend to her aid.","WKL"
id1440,"They were too coarse-limbed for light cavalry charges and they had not the weight for the gun-teams.","ACD"
id2090,"Captain Gerard has volunteered to go, said the colonel.","ACD"
id4686,"Will you take Mrs. Inglethorp her coffee, Cynthia?","ACR"
id6087,"At the end of the first year Death took her--and the spot was rubbed out.","WKL"
id2330,"I passed unquestioned down the broad boulevard, which I have already described, until I came to the great stone convent which formed the outwork of the defence.","ACD"
id2168,"After that it is your guardian angel who must be your guide, for I can help you no more.","ACD"
id2862,"There was a brief notice in the evening papers that a man had been killed in the Tube, and a doubt was expressed whether it was suicide or accident.","ACR"
id5545,"And, what’s more, if you want the truth, it’s because I _can’t_ bury her here that I’m going to leave this house.","WKL"
id3667,"And the dinner, the without doubt excellent dinner, that the _chef_ of Lord Yardly has prepared?","ACR"
id598,"When I said that you stimulated me I meant, to be       frank, that in noting your fallacies I was occasionally guided       towards the truth.","ACD"
id6048,"The cool evening air came in through the open window and lifted the light ribbons in her lace cap, lifted the little lock of hair that had broken loose and drooped over her neck.","WKL"
id1448,"For this reason I always look round for some lady who will be kind enough to teach it to me, and then we practise it together.","ACD"
id1270,"Sir Henry Baskerville listened with the deepest       attention and with an occasional exclamation of surprise.","ACD"
id959,"But       now, Dr. Mortimer, tell me this.","ACD"
id2148,"I enveloped myself in the Franciscan gown.","ACD"
id5655,"Yes.","WKL"
id4476,"He’s staying in the village doing a rest cure, after a bad nervous breakdown.","ACR"
id957,"The original hound was material enough to tug a man’s throat       out, and yet he was diabolical as well.","ACD"
id2484,"I only meant that a resurrection would be awkward for you, he explained.","ACR"
id1284,"But the practical       point which we now have to decide, Sir Henry, is whether it is or       is not advisable for you to go to Baskerville Hall.","ACD"
id2396,"I am continually watched and spied upon.","ACR"
id486,"Look here, sir, said I, backing to the door and opening it; you can be as abusive as you like.","ACD"
id2932,"She had been strangled with a piece of stout black cord, and had evidently been caught unawares with no time to cry out.","ACR"
id917,"And what marks did you see by the wicket-gate?","ACD"
id5469,"I am sorry to hear you are worried.","WKL"
id5696,"Do you wish me to go into the law of the case?","WKL"
id413,"A huge spread of shoulders and a chest like a barrel were the other parts of him which appeared above the table, save for two enormous hands covered with long black hair.","ACD"
id3137,"Nothing more you can tell us about him?","ACR"

id3220,"Poirot drew forward a chair for her, and she commenced talking at once.","ACR"
id1231,"I think we have       drawn as much as we can from this curious letter; and now, Sir       Henry, has anything else of interest happened to you since you       have been in London?","ACD"
id6654,"And yet Captain Wragge had plainly declared that the name on his card would recall a family matter to Mrs. Vanstone’s memory.","WKL"
id988,"I fear lest I should be swayed too much by       my own obvious interest in the matter, and that is why I bring       the case before you and ask for your advice.","ACD"

id2565,"She was not really clever, the Master Criminal of the Underworld caught her each time, but as he seemed loath to knock her on the head in a simple way, and always doomed her to death in a sewer-gas chamber or by some new and marvellous means, the hero was always able to rescue her at the beginning of the following week’s episode.","ACR"

id6074,"V.  ADVANCING from time past to time present, the Prologue leaves the date last attained (the summer of eighteen hundred and fifty-five), and travels on through an interval of twelve years--tells who lived, who died, who prospered, and who failed among the persons concerned in the tragedy at the Hampstead villa--and, this done, leaves the reader at the opening of THE STORY in the spring of eighteen hundred and sixty-eight.","WKL"
id2428,"That is strange, very strange!","ACR"
id2756,"It was settled that I was to start at once to look for something to do.","ACR"
id1553,"Soon, however, I made out that a high and vaulted ceiling covered with painted gods and goddesses was arching over my head.","ACD"
id2545,"Shortly afterwards a reporter called to see Papa, and endeavoured to induce him to write a series of popular articles on the theory.","ACR"
id605,"No, no, my dear Watson, not all—by no means all.","ACD"
id2851,"I held the paper gingerly to my nose.","ACR"
id1109,"You think that he was waiting for someone?","ACD"
id2985,"Yes, I’m quite certain of that.","ACR"

id5592,"My friend, Delamayn.","WKL"

id4143,"Does that list of words tell you nothing?","ACR"
id1702,"The moment of fate had arrived.","ACD"
id5511,"If you’re in earnest--you force a suspicion on me which I would rather not feel.","WKL"
id268,"How?","ACD"
id3924,"The house in question was a kind of superior cottage, standing back a little from the road.","ACR"
id3322,"A comparison of the two stones would be interesting.","ACR"
id5570,"We are both getting hot--we may end in saying what had better have been left unsaid.","WKL"
id3313,"She took it from me, found the article, and began to read aloud:  .","ACR"

id1308,"In an instant Holmes had changed from the       languid dreamer to the man of action.","ACD"
id6638,"He raised his tall hat.","WKL"
id6637,"I congratulate myself—I apologize for occupying your valuable time—I beg my renewed acknowledgments—I wish you good-morning.","WKL"
id530,"This man attacked me, said I.","ACD"
id817,"He declares that he heard cries but is             unable to state from what direction they came.","ACD"

id6067,"Oh, my darling!","WKL"
id3890,"Poirot had made an absolute laughing-stock of me.","ACR"
id2254,"Here!","ACD"
id6889,"At the end of that time, a flying figure in bright garments flashed upon the two gentlemen through the glass—the door was flung open—flower-pots fell in homage to passing petticoats—and Mr. Vanstone’s youngest daughter ran up to him at headlong speed, with every external appearance of having suddenly taken leave of her senses.","WKL"
id4424,"I said right out: ‘You’re an old woman, Emily, and there’s no fool like an old fool.","ACR"

id77,"Well, what is it that he does that I don't do?","ACD"
id4234,"As he spoke the last words, we drew up in front of the fine old house.","ACR"
id5569,"I want no farther talk about it now.","WKL"
id3983,"She showed us into a small morning-room, and retired to tell her mistress.","ACR"
id5584,"Have you kept the thing a secret out of regard for _her?_  Yes.","WKL"
id4105,"Oh, no, said Poirot reassuringly.","ACR"
id1250,"You have lost one of your boots, you say?","ACD"
id6410,"Let her caper and kick in the paddock to her heart’s content.","WKL"
id5051,"Sarah obeyed; and Mrs. Treverton taking the paper from her, pointed to it solemnly, with a return of the stage gesture which had escaped her a little while back.","WKL"
id5706,"Mr. Delamayn smiled.","WKL"
id3944,"I have tried to spare her all I can, but of course the shock was bound to be considerable.","ACR"
id6860,"Plenty began in that way, and got over it, and did wonders afterward.","WKL"
id3271,"She leaned forward, unclosing her hand.","ACR"
id2994,"Nothing unusual in that, said the inspector dryly.","ACR"
id4188,"I can tell you, Hastings, it’s making life jolly difficult for us.","ACR"
id4747,"The most alarming sounds were audible from the interior of the room.","ACR"
id6319,"He flourished his stick gayly, as he observed his eldest daughter at the window.","WKL"
id1924,"I have betrayed my country, I have broken my vow, I have ruined my friends, and I have given my life in order to save you.","ACD"
id2782,"I listened and contained myself with difficulty.","ACR"
id4734,"What’s the matter?","ACR"
id1089,"Yes, I have thought a good deal of it in the course of the day.","ACD"
id2720,"Oh, thank you, but will Mrs. Flemming——  My wife will be delighted to welcome you.","ACR"
id5439,"What have _you_ to do with it?","WKL"
id5653,"Yes.","WKL"
id6914,"He now came forward with a face expressive of speechless amazement.","WKL"
id4047,"No, no, I must resign myself to the fact that all here is clear and above-board—but who is this?","ACR"
id6651,"Neither of them recollected to have heard it before.","WKL"
id390,"Dear me!","ACD"
id1751,"You will tell us that when you have made a part payment, said he.","ACD"
id2554,"All Papa’s friends were aged Professors—usually with long beards.","ACR"

id1956,"Or perhaps it may not be so.","ACD"
id6291,"But her beauty as a young woman had passed beyond the average national limits; and she still preserved the advantage of her more exceptional personal gifts.","WKL"
id1610,"It was the grey-beard who at last broke the silence.","ACD"
id4340,"Might.","ACR"
id3718,"One cannot think of everything!","ACR"
id5735,"That is a curiously hot-headed man, remarked Mr. Delamayn.","WKL"
id301,"Protests, Uproar, and General appeal to the Chairman were three of the first brackets which caught my eye.","ACD"
id5440,"he asked.","WKL"
id2070,"said he.","ACD"
id6950,"She took her father’s arm, and moved on with him to the door of the greenhouse.","WKL"
id1287,"Do you mean danger from this family fiend or do you mean danger       from human beings?","ACD"
id5338,"Both were the children of poor parents, both had been pupil-teachers at the school; and both were destined to earn their own bread.","WKL"
id3947,"What?","ACR"
id5200,"Rest, mistress--he shall have the letter.","WKL"
id4194,"Not precisely young and beautiful, but as game as they make them.","ACR"
id2644,"Safety, that was what I was being offered.","ACR"
id2126,"Is he ill, or wounded, or dead?","ACD"
id2225,"Cautiously I pressed the latch, and I felt that it had yielded.","ACD"
id5893,"Pardon me for speaking in that familiar way.","WKL"
id6527,"As the grating sound of the carriage-wheels ceased suddenly at a turn in the road, the sisters looked one another in the face; each feeling, and each betraying in her own way, the dreary sense that she was openly excluded, for the first time, from the confidence of her parents.","WKL"
id4932,"Not the doctor?","WKL"
id6130,"_Will she end like Me?_  The question was put with the laboring breath, with the heavy accents which tell that death is near.","WKL"
id3191,"What?","ACR"
id3209,"That is Miss Marvell.","ACR"
id3110,"You didn’t see any one?","ACR"
id563,"Well, Watson, what do you make of it?","ACD"
id5348,"There, among strangers, she was to be perfected in the actress’s and the singer’s art; then to return to England, and make the fortune of her family on the lyric stage.","WKL"
id4583,"Yet he had a certain charm of manner, and I fancied that, if one really knew him well, one could have a deep affection for him.","ACR"
id4944,"what will happen now!","WKL"
id6225,"The London _Gazette_ announced him to the world as Baron Holchester of Holchester.","WKL"
id6385,"when we had crash-bang for forty minutes, with three stoppages by-the-way, what did they call it?","WKL"
id3665,"This way of describing events almost caused me to smile, but I stuck to my guns.","ACR"
id4275,"You are so thoughtful, Alfred dear.","ACR"
id114,"She looked at me with rather more interest.","ACD"
id6592,"The younger lady, he proceeded, takes after her father, I presume?","WKL"
id5373,"On the evening on which this scene opens a lady and two gentlemen were seated at the dinner-table.","WKL"
id5205,"After repeatedly knocking at the door and obtaining no answer, she ventured to go in.","WKL"
id3750,"I asked.","ACR"
id5474,"Mrs. Vanborough rose immediately.","WKL"
id2116,"How can it be reached?","ACD"
id5575,"Mr. Vanborough’s face betrayed signs of embarrassment.","WKL"
id2203,"You will see here how important it is not to neglect small precautions, for had I left the man's gun where I found it, a search must have followed and I should certainly have been discovered.","ACD"
id5977,"You don’t go yet!","WKL"
id3991,"_Les affaires_—they know no mercy.","ACR"
id4767,"Mary Cavendish was there, shaking the girl—who must have been an unusually sound sleeper—and trying to wake her.","ACR"
id3896,"I feared you would not have returned in time to accompany me.","ACR"
id5467,"Are you in pain?","WKL"
id2073,"By right because I am the senior captain.","ACD"
id2835,"A sudden nausea seized me, and I turned blindly and ran up the stairs again towards the lift.","ACR"
id3799,"Convey, I beg of you, the assurances of my deepest respect to Lady Yardly, and tell her how pleased I am to be able to restore her jewel to her.","ACR"
id3725,"A pale-faced clerk sat opposite them.","ACR"
id2872,"It was in the name of L. B. Carton, Russell Hotel.","ACR"
id5992,"I was a singer on the stage, she said, when I was a single woman.","WKL"
id4088,"You came down—when?","ACR"
id3876,"She told you that the letters were destroyed?","ACR"
id6479,"The servant, ignorant of what had happened, went in to clear the table—found his master and mistress seated close together in deep consultation—and immediately went out again.","WKL"
id2085,"Lanes had been driven through it and lanterns placed at the corners with inscriptions to direct the wayfarer.","ACD"
id2535,"He ate what was put before him in an exemplary fashion, but seemed mildly pained when the question of paying for it arose.","ACR"
id2723,"We will send her a wire from the station, continued the lawyer.","ACR"
id4164,"He was a good fifteen years my senior, for one thing, though he hardly looked his forty-five years.","ACR"
id6134,"For God’s sake, don’t think that!","WKL"
id3409,"You have the letters with you?","ACR"
id6229,"The hands on the hall-clock pointed to half-past six in the morning.","WKL"
id1341,"I was looking out for loiterers in the street, but I saw none.","ACD"
id3809,"Rolf?","ACR"
id4122,"Journey.","ACR"
id477,"You've got out of your station.","ACD"
id4251,"Where’s tea to-day—inside or out?","ACR"
id3425,"When my friend returned, I enjoyed telling him the tale of what had occurred during his absence.","ACR"
id1082,"The one is       whether any crime has been committed at all; the second is, what       is the crime and how was it committed?","ACD"
id3518,"Permit that I make a guess?","ACR"
id1725,"I shrugged my shoulders and said nothing.","ACD"
id432,"G. E. C. is happiest then.","ACD"
id4972,"She turned again toward the table.","WKL"
id3211,"After a short interval, the American film star was ushered in, and we rose to our feet.","ACR"
id2522,"You see, my life had such a dreadful sameness.","ACR"
id1501,"The fellow stands behind you and above you as he rows, so that you can neither see him nor can you in any way guard against such an assault.","ACD"
id6467,"May I ask—what right you had to pry into your father’s private affairs?","WKL"
id1116,"That night he waited there.","ACD"
id907,"Were they on the same side of the path as the moor-gate?","ACD"
id4279,"Why, if it isn’t too delightful to see you again, Mr. Hastings, after all these years.","ACR"
id6014,"Lady Jane handed the certificate to the lawyer.","WKL"
id2408,"The game begins to be dangerous?","ACR"
id3956,"Yes, the body had not been touched.","ACR"
id6488,"Miss Garth dropped her work on her lap; even the sedate Norah started to her feet, and amazedly repeated the words, Going to London!","WKL"
id5483,"I will do my best, John.","WKL"
id6593,"I assure you, her face struck me.","WKL"
id1638,"I understood from what I had heard that I should soon have to leave it again in order to appear before this tribunal, but still it is not my nature to throw away any possible chances.","ACD"
id6001,"Mr. Vanborough looked back into the far corner of the room, in which the lawyer sat, impenetrably waiting for events.","WKL"
id4078,"She was clearly taken aback, and he—_eh bien_, he was very devoted, did you not think so?","ACR"
id5912,"Mr. Vanborough told me you were that gentleman’s wife.","WKL"
id2374,"Let me see.","ACR"
id2164,"Here the sergeant stopped.","ACD"
id4196,"Oh, this fellow!","ACR"
id3120,"I’ve worked in Hospital during the war, and I’ve seen doctors handle bodies.","ACR"
id3887,"_Mon Dieu!_ but how you enrage yourself for nothing, _mon ami_!","ACR"
id4607,"His moustache was very stiff and military.","ACR"
id5573,"What is it?","WKL"
id2072,"Why so, Captain Gerard?","ACD"
id406,"I was prepared for something strange, but not for so overpowering a personality as this.","ACD"
id6459,"Norah, he said, after an interval, you needn’t wait for me.","WKL"
id1749,"He who enjoys such privileges must pay a price for them.","ACD"
id3393,"She has just left.","ACR"
id5211,"The direction she now compelled herself to take led her a little way down the stairs again.","WKL"
id6830,"Ordinary men would have been astonished.","WKL"
id214,"British Museum Assistant, 1892.","ACD"
id3469,"I am not acting for Miss Marvell since she refuses to be guided by my advice.","ACR"
id1423,"From Moscow to Cairo we had travelled everywhere, but we went in larger parties than were convenient to those whom we visited, and we carried our passports in our limbers.","ACD"
id6728,"This was the one noticeable result of their journey—this, and no more.","WKL"
id618,"When would his friends       unite to give him a pledge of their good will?","ACD"
id4187,"he said savagely.","ACR"
id3066,"A satellite, also in plain clothes, sat unobtrusively in a corner.","ACR"
id6139,"Don’t bring her up like Me!","WKL"
id2328,"You will understand, you who know me so well, that I was not the man to return tamely to the French camp with the report that our agent was dead and that other means must be found of entering the city.","ACD"
id6528,"Norah’s customary reserve strengthened into sullen silence—she sat down in one of the hall chairs and looked out frowningly through the open house door.","WKL"
id3279,"No, no, I’m very careful really, Monsieur Poirot.","ACR"
id273,"You don't say?","ACD"
id1854,"She wrestled with me, this delicate creature, and by main force she dragged me to the opening between the cells.","ACD"
id1652,"I wish I could forget what I heard.","ACD"
id1568,"Never in the world was a command obeyed so promptly as that one.","ACD"
id5232,"Two pretty chintz curtains, hanging inside the trellis-work, formed the only barrier between the day-room and the bedroom.","WKL"
id3128,"In running his hands over the upper part of the man’s body he would have ample opportunity to take anything he wanted from the pockets.","ACR"
id5126,"He spoke first to the servant who had followed him.","WKL"
id355,"As to your suggestion that I may modify my opinion, I would have you know that it is not my habit to do so after a deliberate expression of my mature views.","ACD"
id4702,"I glanced jealously at Mary Cavendish, but she seemed quite undisturbed, the delicate pallor of her cheeks did not vary.","ACR"
id4254,"Come on then, you’ve done enough gardening for to-day.","ACR"
id4069,"Rather reluctantly, it seemed to me, Mrs. Maltravers made the necessary introduction.","ACR"
id5480,"Mrs. Vanborough sighed as she turned to the door.","WKL"
id3160,"And my friend joined me at the window.","ACR"
id3722,"Better luck next time.","ACR"
id4017,"And now, madame, if I might see——  He paused delicately.","ACR"
id5153,"I distrusted her, Sir, the very first day I entered the house.","WKL"
id272,"The answer was unprintable.","ACD"
id6317,"On the far side of a garden and paddock the view overlooked a stream, some farm buildings which lay beyond, and the opening of a wooded, rocky pass (called, in Somersetshire, a Combe), which here cleft its way through the hills that closed the prospect.","WKL"
id6891,"the dream of my whole life is realized, she said, as soon as she could speak.","WKL"
id1169,"Don’t you think       that is an admirable sentiment?","ACD"
id2,"I am convinced that he really believed in his heart that I came round to the Chestnuts three days a week for the pleasure of his company, and very especially to hear his views upon bimetallism, a subject upon which he was by way of being an authority.","ACD"
id5219,"No.","WKL"
id3645,"He tore my necklace from my neck with such force that I fell headlong to the floor.","ACR"
id2983,"Injured dignity went to the wall.","ACR"
id3431,"_Bien!_ he said at length, with a curious look on his face.","ACR"
id2937,"The accident in the Tube, dismissed as a coincidence, faded out of the public mind.","ACR"
id2837,"I must get out into the open air.","ACR"
id4106,"You see, it is like this, I give you a word, you answer with another, and so on.","ACR"
id4497,"My dear Hastings, I don’t mind telling you that I’m at my wits’ end for money.","ACR"
id2770,"The whole effect pleased me very much.","ACR"
id4891,"The instant she saw her master she started back from him.","WKL"
id5782,"Tell the house-maid, and show the lady in.","WKL"
id2050,"I must, however, beg you to have the courtesy to name the place of meeting, since I am still ignorant of the locality.","ACD"
id5665,"You were formally received into the Roman Catholic Church?","WKL"
id6929,"She confided in me.","WKL"
id5251,"She gets stranger than ever in her ways, he said, when he rejoined his fellow-servant, after Sarah had hurried past him into the open air.","WKL"
id2337,"I began to realise how odious was our task as I looked upon the motley but ferocious groups who were gathered round the watch-fires in the garden of the Convent of the Madonna.","ACD"
id2262,"Again with tremulous fingers I struck the flint against the steel, and this time I lit not only the tinder but the wax taper.","ACD"
id4271,"In case of a refusal, Lady Tadminster might open it the first day, and Mrs. Crosbie the second.","ACR"
id4049,"He passed us without making any sign, but I noted that he was not ill-looking, with a lean, deeply bronzed face that spoke of life in a tropic clime.","ACR"
id4812,"I could see by the expression on his face that he himself had little hope.","ACR"
id1304,"I’ll join you in a walk, with pleasure, said his companion.","ACD"
id5718,"It _is_ the law, returned Mr. Delamayn, as a sufficient answer to him.","WKL"
id3136,"But from this moment I gave the inspector up as hopeless.","ACR"
id1150,"The word moor only was printed in ink.","ACD"
id1871,"But how would that help Lucia?","ACD"
id1335,"A spy?","ACD"
id2768,"Then I did under my eyes with burnt cork.","ACR"
id1201,"The other words were all       simple and might be found in any issue, but ‘moor’ would be less       common.","ACD"
id2077,"I think that you are indeed best fitted to go upon this mission.","ACD"
id6633,"My name will be quite sufficient to recall a little family matter to Mrs. Vanstone, which has no doubt escaped her memory.","WKL"
id4538,"We had a pleasant luncheon, and as we drove away Lawrence suggested that we should return by Tadminster, which was barely a mile out of our way, and pay a visit to Cynthia in her dispensary.","ACR"
id5457,"The people who want to take a house are the born enemies of the people who want to let a house.","WKL"
id2224,"There was no light within and the door was shut.","ACD"
id428,"Well, at least you are better than that herd of swine in Vienna, whose gregarious grunt is, however, not more offensive than the isolated effort of the British hog.","ACD"
id837,"For this reason I saw a       good deal of Sir Charles Baskerville.","ACD"
id4373,"They simp-ly _are_!","ACR"
id4687,"I will pour it out.","ACR"
id3661,"Well—I coughed delicately—things haven’t gone very well, have they?","ACR"
id6084,"These were his triumphs, and this his rate of progress on the way to the peerage, during the first year of his life as the husband of Lady Jane.","WKL"
id6413,"She unlocked the post-bag at the sideboard and poured out the letters in a heap.","WKL"
id2253,"I cried.","ACD"
id1822,"And yet I love that you should care all the same.","ACD"
id2218,"The fellow released my sleeve and shrank back in silence, while I, with a solemn gesture, hurried upon my way.","ACD"
id5875,"Mrs. Vanborough returned the bow coldly--entered the room first--and then answered, Yes.","WKL"
id4801,"We thronged round her, powerless to help or alleviate.","ACR"
id2853,"But, then——  I folded up the paper carefully and put it in my bag.","ACR"
id4724,"I must see our agent over those estate accounts.","ACR"
id5289,"The shock which the words spoken by her master in the nursery had communicated to her mind, had set her whole nature, so to speak, at bay, and had roused in her, at last, the moral courage to arm herself with a final and desperate resolution.","WKL"
id6664,"Mrs. Vanstone’s letter extended to some length.","WKL"
id5374,"The lady had reached the mature age of forty-two.","WKL"
id445,"What evidence?","ACD"
id5615,"Mr. Delamayn was habitually polite to every body--but he had never been known to say one unnecessary word to his dearest friend.","WKL"
id4033,"But, as to why he insured his life, it was because he had absolutely made up his mind that he would not live long.","ACR"
id5957,"Mrs. Vanborough staggered back.","WKL"

id488,"You shall not assault me.","ACD"

id5261,"The old church, with the hedge of myrtle and fuchsia growing round the little cemetery in all the luxuriance which is only seen in Cornwall, was clearing and brightening to view, almost as fast as the morning firmament itself.","WKL"
id3738,"The eyes slanted up at the corners like an Oriental’s.","ACR"
id6090,"He offered (through his lawyer ) a handsome provision for her and for her child.","WKL"
id411,"The hair was peculiar, plastered down in front in a long, curving wisp over his massive forehead.","ACD"
id6942,"If you don’t know how, come to me and I’ll teach you.","WKL"
id4317,"Oh, Sherlock Holmes by all means.","ACR"
id6993,"Gentlemen came; saw Julia at rehearsal; observed her stoutness and her wig; omitted to notice that her heart was in the right place; quailed at the prospect, apologized, and retired.","WKL"
id6135,"The wildness began to appear again in Anne Silvester’s eyes.","WKL"
id2287,"Good heavens!","ACD"
id6505,"Mrs. Vanstone was, in another way, equally inaccessible.","WKL"
id5191,"Still fixedly looking at it over her shoulder, she crept along the wall to the door.","WKL"
id336,"But what do you mean to do?","ACD"
id6259,"Judging him by lightness of heart, strength of constitution, and capacity for enjoyment, he was no older than most men who have only turned thirty.","WKL"
id969,"From the       accounts which have reached us he is an excellent fellow in every       way.","ACD"
id1766,"Courage, friend, courage!","ACD"
id6339,"Her figure—taller than her sister’s, taller than the average of woman’s height; instinct with such a seductive, serpentine suppleness, so lightly and playfully graceful, that its movements suggested, not unnaturally, the movements of a young cat—her figure was so perfectly developed already that no one who saw her could have supposed that she was only eighteen.","WKL"
id2204,"As it was, the patrol saw no sign of their sentry, and thought, no doubt, that he had moved along the line of the roofs.","ACD"
id6968,"So, with a trifling gesture of invitation on one side, with a trifling act of compliance on the other: so—with no knowledge in his mind, with no thought in hers, of the secret still hidden under the journey to London—they took the way which led to that secret’s discovery, through many a darker winding that was yet to come.","WKL"
id6691,"She now felt it due to that friendship to explain confidentially the motive which had induced her to leave home with her husband.","WKL"
id5255,"CHAPTER III.","WKL"
id5046,"Sign 'Sarah Leeson, witness.'","WKL"
id421,"Oh, you are the young person who cannot understand plain English, are you?","ACD"
id3288,"Some gossip—what was it now?","ACR"
id2820,"People came running up.","ACR"
id2042,"Evidently they still thought that they had to do with some empty braggart.","ACD"
id109,"Now, when you described the Wigan coal explosion last month, could you not have gone down and helped those people, in spite of the choke-damp?","ACD"
id3545,"It is that I investigate still this affair of Miss Marvell’s.","ACR"
id5911,"I will speak louder if you wish it, she said.","WKL"
id2266,"The poor wretch was in his last agony, his head sunk upon his shoulder and his blackened tongue protruding from his lips.","ACD"

id4371,"I don’t wonder.","ACR"
id4128,"Rook Rifle.","ACR"
id6288,"At the end of that time, two ladies appeared, descending to the breakfast-room together—Mrs.","WKL"

id6113,"She shall be _my_ child, Anne, when you are gone.","WKL"
id3350,"Madame, I have advised.","ACR"
id1815,"The president has ordered that my ear be cut off, that I may be marked for ever as having loved a Frenchman.","ACD"
id2421,"He paused, almost as though he were expecting her to disagree with him, but she remained silent, smiling to herself as before.","ACR"
id4514,"For the convenience of the reader I will recapitulate the incidents of those days in as exact a manner as possible.","ACR"
id1653,"Many a hundred men have I seen die in battle, and I have slain more myself than I care to think of, but all that was fair fight and the duty of a soldier.","ACD"
id133,"She laughed at my sudden Irish effervescence.","ACD"
id2663,"He sighed again.","ACR"
id5966,"It is possible to blame him severely, and to insist on his reformation in the most uncompromising terms.","WKL"
id4935,"The hand was weak; but even in that momentary action of it there was no mistaking the gesture of command.","WKL"
id5299,"Not to destroy the letter, and not to take it away with her if she left the house.","WKL"
id3755,"Is it permitted to see Madame?","ACR"
id697,"Holmes was silent, but his little darting glances showed me the       interest which he took in our curious companion.","ACD"
id3228,"Miss Marvell unclasped her handbag, and drew out three envelopes which she handed to Poirot.","ACR"
id2681,"From the first I felt that it was quite useless to try to convince him of the contrary.","ACR"
id2312,"That motion to reach the wine with his lips had been his last.","ACD"
id6043,"Then minutes passed.","WKL"
id6223,"They whispered confidentially, Will you take it with a peerage?","WKL"
id2371,"A knock at the door interrupted the flow.","ACR"
id53,"Is it my appearance, or what?","ACD"
id2688,"I knew that quite as well, if not better than Mr. Flemming, but I restrained myself from saying so.","ACR"
id1370,"Ah, Wilson, I see you have not forgotten the little case in       which I had the good fortune to help you?","ACD"
id3960,"Gastric ulcer, without a doubt.","ACR"
id2732,"I might as well look as much like the popular conception of an orphan as possible.","ACR"
id4140,"And now, Hastings, said Poirot, smiling at me as the door closed behind him.","ACR"
id5418,"The words were spoken with undisguised contempt of tone and manner.","WKL"
id5521,"If you force me to it, I take the freedom of an old friend, and I say you are not treating her fairly.","WKL"
id5132,"She seems unreasonably shocked and terrified by what has happened.","WKL"
id1886,"She's bleeding fast, said one of the valets.","ACD"
id4053,"I don’t remember his name, sir, though I did hear it.","ACR"
id6671,"She was left, at the present writing, without a relation in the world—excepting, perhaps, certain cousins whom she had never seen, and of whose existence even, at the present moment, she possessed no positive knowledge.","WKL"
id306,"It is certainly rather deep for a layman.","ACD"
id2583,"I shall be interested to note whether the implements are typical of the Mousterian period—there will be the remains of the primitive ox, I should say, but not those of the woolly rhinoceros.","ACR"
id50,"You must love!","ACD"
id968,"On the death of Sir Charles we inquired for this young       gentleman and found that he had been farming in Canada.","ACD"
id1165,"Capital article this on free trade.","ACD"
id5838,"He answered silently by an affirmative inclination of the head, which dextrously turned Mrs. Vanborough into to Mrs. Delamayn without allowing Mr. Delamayn the opportunity of hearing it.","WKL"
id3791,"It was a great diamond.","ACR"
id3833,"All goes well.","ACR"
id6676,"Shrinking, naturally, from allowing her husband to be annoyed, and probably cheated as well, by any person who claimed, however preposterously, a family connection with herself, it had been her practice, for many years past, to assist the captain from her own purse, on the condition that he should never come near the house, and that he should not presume to make any application whatever to Mr. Vanstone.","WKL"
id6150,"_Will she end like Me?_  VI.","WKL"
id462,"Shall I tell you?","ACD"
id4044,"You noticed it?","ACR"
id6433,"Who do you know at New Orleans?","WKL"
id6382,"It stopped three times, by-the-way; and we all thought it was done each time, and clapped our hands, rejoiced to be rid of it.","WKL"
id3273,"Poirot drew in his breath with a long hiss.","ACR"
id3693,"In answer to my persuasions, he pointed out, with admirable common sense, that as the details of the affair at Yardly Chase were already in the morning papers the Rolfs would know quite as much as we could tell them.","ACR"
id5234,"The first object that attracted her attention in the child's bedroom was the figure of the nurse-maid, leaning back, fast asleep, in an easy-chair by the window.","WKL"
id2323,"The cathedral was brilliantly lit within, and a number of people were passing in and out; so I entered, thinking that I was less likely to be accosted there, and that I might have quiet to form my plans.","ACD"
id6625,"A most valuable suggestion.","WKL"
id5148,"A strange woman!","WKL"
id1200,"Because he could not find it in print.","ACD"
id1198,"With gum on to the paper.","ACD"
id186,"I wonder whether you could get on friendly--or at least on talking terms with the fellow, he said, at last.","ACD"
id1517,"The fellow knocked three times with his oar upon wood, and in answer to his summons I heard the rasping of bars and the turning of keys.","ACD"
id556,"The man-servant, Austin, like a wooden image, closed the door behind us.","ACD"
id2329,"Either I should find some means to finish his uncompleted task or there would be a vacancy for a senior captain in the Hussars of Conflans.","ACD"
id1495,"Then I thought also of my dear mother, and I fancied her joy when she heard the folk in the village talking about the fame of her son.","ACD"
id2039,"They looked in surprise from one to the other.","ACD"
id6327,"Even her father and mother had asked themselves those questions, as she grew up to girlhood, and had been sorely perplexed to answer them.","WKL"
id5291,"What binds me to give the letter to my master at all?","WKL"
id1488,"My sword was at my belt, but it is not always the most convenient of weapons.","ACD"
id3397,"For a moment she hesitated, as though in doubt whether to trust me or not, then she bowed her head in assent with a little smile.","ACR"
id1387,"You will begin in each case by giving the outside porter one       shilling.","ACD"
id1748,"You, an upstart adventurer and foreigner, have dared to raise your eyes in love to the grand daughter of a Doge of Venice who was already betrothed to the heir of the Loredans.","ACD"
id2429,"Through a woman, you say?","ACR"
id2338,"It was not for us soldiers to think about politics, but from the beginning there always seemed to be a curse upon this war in Spain.","ACD"
id5283,"The outside view of the range of north rooms, from the weedy, deserted garden below, showed plainly enough that many years had passed since any human creature had inhabited them.","WKL"
id478,"Time was when your ears were clipped.","ACD"
id5029,"She rolled her head restlessly from side to side of the pillow--repeated vacantly a few lines from one of the old play-books which had been removed from her bed--and suddenly held out the pen to the servant, with a theatrical wave of the hand, and a glance upward at an imaginary gallery of spectators.","WKL"
id3668,"Oh, what’s dinner!","ACR"
id853,"I mention this small       episode because it assumes some importance in view of the tragedy       which followed, but I was convinced at the time that the matter       was entirely trivial and that his excitement had no       justification.","ACD"
id3434,"He turned the leaves.","ACR"
id551,"The Professor looked at me, and there was something humorous at the back of his eyes.","ACD"
id2229,"I felt round and came upon the edge of a table.","ACD"
id804,"The facts of the case are simple.","ACD"
id6854,"Personally, he was liked by all who knew him; and his future prosperity was heartily desired by the many friends whom he had made in the North.","WKL"
id4855,"A low, clear, sweet voice, inside the room, inquired who was waiting without?","WKL"
id3703,"I cried, springing up.","ACR"
id6310,"A perfect wreck; a living proof of your wisdom and mine in staying at home.","WKL"
id705,"Then had you not better consult him?","ACD"
id6925,"explaining myself to Frank—  I beg your pardon, began Frank, attempting, at this point, to enter his protest.","WKL"
id3646,"As I fell I saw him disappearing through the side door.","ACR"
id5245,"Reckless whether she was heard or not, she turned and ran into the passage as if she had been flying for her life.","WKL"
id4242,"Weeds grow like house afire.","ACR"
id5384,"The door opened, and a girl twelve years old entered, lending by the hand a younger girl of five.","WKL"
id4560,"Sister is very sorry.","ACR"
id4461,"All I ask you is to keep your eyes open.","ACR"
id1608,"I do not think that anyone could have carried himself better under such difficult circumstances.","ACD"
id2706,"He hesitated a minute, and then said: Supposing—how would it be if you came to us for a time?","ACR"
id4691,"Lawrence followed him, and Mrs. Cavendish sat down by us.","ACR"
id4219,"My dear fellow, that’s just what I want.","ACR"
id778,"[This from Hugo Baskerville to his sons Rodger and John,             with instructions that they say nothing thereof to their             sister Elizabeth.]","ACD"
id4539,"Mrs. Inglethorp replied that this was an excellent idea, but as she had several letters to write she would drop us there, and we could come back with Cynthia in the pony-trap.","ACR"
id4685,"she asked.","ACR"
id4390,"We are quite a war household; nothing is wasted here—every scrap of waste paper, even, is saved and sent away in sacks.","ACR"
id240,"Anyway, you are all safe.","ACD"
id1097,"He only repeated what some fool had said at the inquest.","ACD"
id4245,"Better be careful.","ACR"
id4950,"The doctor, she said.","WKL"
id6591,"The stranger acknowledged the interruption by one of his polite bows, and submerged Miss Garth in his next sentence as if nothing had happened.","WKL"
id5462,"This time the tone was almost brutal.","WKL"
id55,"She put forward a hand--such a gracious, stooping attitude it was--and she pressed back my head.","ACD"
id3260,"When is the date of the full moon?","ACR"
id3290,"it came to me in a flash—of course it was none other than Gregory B. Rolf.","ACR"
id1656,"They must have taken him into the third cell, the one which was farthest from me.","ACD"
id4715,"Just carry up my despatch-case, will you, dear?","ACR"
id1055,"On the contrary, I have been to Devonshire.","ACD"
id2910,"She gave the name of Mrs. de Castina and her address as the Ritz, but there proved to be no one of that name staying there, and the hotel people failed to identify the body.","ACR"
id1796,"He loved me, and I thought I loved him until--until I learned what love is, Etienne.","ACD"
id6443,"It was not the effect which she, or any one, could have anticipated.","WKL"
id1336,"Well, it was evident from what we have heard that Baskerville       has been very closely shadowed by someone since he has been in       town.","ACD"
id1360,"We had been sauntering slowly down Regent Street during this       conversation, and Dr. Mortimer, with his companion, had long       vanished in front of us.","ACD"
id6543,"We’ll lunch at one, and take the dogs out afterward.","WKL"
id6250,"Thomas could hum none of the songs, and could describe none of the ladies’ dresses.","WKL"
id3060,"No doubt I was prejudiced—the Tube incident was my own pet mystery—but there certainly seemed to me to be a connection of some kind between the two fatalities.","ACR"
id3533,"We will arrive shortly after five.","ACR"
id4205,"The fellow must be at least twenty years younger than she is!","ACR"
id2036,"Whom would you fight, then?","ACD"
id3925,"A brass plate on the gate bore the doctor’s name.","ACR"
id4844,"It was dark and empty.","WKL"
id3259,"_Voyons!_ said Poirot, turning the leaves.","ACR"
id1864,"To their eyes I was only a dark blur in the corner.","ACD"
id6302,"In these days of insidious nervous exhaustion and subtly-spreading nervous malady, is it not possible that the same rule may apply, less rarely than we are willing to admit, to the bodily gifts as well?","WKL"
id547,"Now, then!","ACD"
id2515,"Lor’, miss, what a beyewtiful book you might make out of it all—just like the pictures!).","ACR"
id5605,"I have no objection whatever.","WKL"
id6164,"He admitted that he was weary of England.","WKL"
id159,"You have the true descreeptive touch.","ACD"
id6098,"She was making her way; she was winning sympathy, confidence, and respect every where--when she sank suddenly at the opening of her new life.","WKL"
id5515,"What do you suspect?","WKL"
id2552,"In between times, to keep her hand in as she expressed it, she walked out with the greengrocer’s young man, and the chemist’s assistant.","ACR"
id2108,"said Lannes, briefly.","ACD"
id5415,"Is there such a thing as hereditary love as well?","WKL"
id6776,"Fortunately for the boys, Mr. Vanstone’s views were still fast imprisoned in the ordinary prejudices.","WKL"
id4951,"Let me call the doctor.","WKL"
id6828,"While this important announcement lay unsuspected in Mr. Vanstone’s pocket, the object of it was traveling home, as fast as railways could take him.","WKL"
id6521,"CHAPTER II.","WKL"
id75,"Oh, he might look very much like you.","ACD"
id571,"I think, said I, following as far as I could the methods of my       companion, that Dr. Mortimer is a successful, elderly medical       man, well-esteemed since those who know him give him this mark of       their appreciation.","ACD"
id274,"Well, a bowdlerized version of it would run:  'Professor Challenger presents his compliments to the President of the Zoological Institute, and would take it as a personal favor if he would go to the devil.'","ACD"
id3657,"I drew Poirot aside.","ACR"
id851,"It was gone, however, and the incident appeared to make the       worst impression upon his mind.","ACD"
id6948,"Don’t let me have to speak a second time, Frank.","WKL"
id4009,"Not since lunch.","ACR"
id6608,"I had anticipated the pleasure of communicating with Mrs. Vanstone, answered this inveterately evasive and inveterately civil man.","WKL"
id6323,"In another moment the youngest of Mr. Vanstone’s two daughters (and two only surviving children) dashed into view on the dingy old oaken stairs, with the suddenness of a flash of light; and clearing the last three steps into the hall at a jump, presented herself breathless in the breakfast-room to make the family circle complete.","WKL"
id3046,"The house-agents also recognized it as that of Mrs. de Castina.","ACR"
id4740,"John Cavendish joined us, and one or two of the servants were standing round in a state of awe-stricken excitement.","ACR"
id1761,"My first thought was to establish connection with my neighbour in misfortune.","ACD"
id3856,"I said to him that Lady Yardly had told her husband all, that I was empowered to recover the jewel, and that if it were not immediately handed over proceedings would be taken.","ACR"
id1339,"You may have observed that I twice strolled over to the       window while Dr. Mortimer was reading his legend.","ACD"
id5180,"Why give it to him at all?","WKL"
id3366,"I’ve told her he was out, but she says as how she’ll wait, seeing as she’s come up from the country.","ACR"
id4980,"Sarah put her hand on the bolt.","WKL"
id1147,"This he opened and spread flat upon the       table.","ACD"
id4263,"I shall never forget them.","ACR"
id4135,"_Lawyers_.","ACR"
id5091,"I'm dying with all my senses about me, Sarah; you can't deceive me even yet.","WKL"
id2805,"And yet most men begin to wear their winter overcoats before January, and consequently by this time the smell ought to have worn off.","ACR"
id2942,"It was the consideration of these other things that finally impelled me to what I considered a dashing step.","ACR"
id3849,"I demand pardon, my friend.","ACR"
id5405,"Sir Thomas was ill at the time, and his wife couldn’t leave him.","WKL"
id854,"It was at my advice that Sir Charles was about to go to London.","ACD"
id613,"Apply them!","ACD"
id4995,"Bring them, and you will see.","WKL"
id6077,"He entered Parliament.","WKL"
id1458,"Of the dark type I do not recall her equal unless it were Dolores of Toledo.","ACD"
id2187,"The sentry looked round and everything was still and safe.","ACD"
id3338,"Just one big hoax, same as I do?","ACR"
id5202,"Descending hurriedly, as if she feared to give herself time to think, she reached Captain Treverton's study, on the ground-floor, in a minute or two.","WKL"
id967,"Yes.","ACD"
id4825,"How came you to know that?","WKL"
id5369,"This was in the summer of eighteen hundred and thirty-one.","WKL"
id5874,"she said, with a gracious smile.","WKL"
id4992,"I forbid you to go near it again.","WKL"
id1697,"We have already been merciful, the other answered.","ACD"
id620,"We know there       has been a presentation.","ACD"
id2559,"The village possessed a lending library, full of tattered works of fiction, and I enjoyed perils and love-making at second hand, and went to sleep dreaming of stern, silent Rhodesians, and of strong men who always felled their opponent with a single blow.","ACR"
id4836,"The younger servant took a candle and obeyed.","WKL"
id3619,"I swooped joyously down on it.","ACR"
id502,"I'll not stand it.","ACD"
id4711,"Thank you, I will.","ACR"
id371,"Right!","ACD"
id1058,"My body has remained in this armchair and has, I regret       to observe, consumed in my absence two large pots of coffee and       an incredible amount of tobacco.","ACD"
id2128,"We cannot determine this until we have heard from him.","ACD"
id5377,"The third person was a guest.","WKL"
id2212,"He pointed to a woman who lay motionless on the road, and I took him to mean that she was dying, and that he desired me to administer the last offices of the Church.","ACD"
id1573,"I turned toward the staircase, but two men were coming down it.","ACD"
id4985,"The color began to deepen perceptibly all over her face, and the light to grow brighter in her widely opened eyes.","WKL"
id3493,"His face darkened with anger as he read.","ACR"
id4208,"Difficult!","ACR"
id1161,"Have you yesterday’s _Times_, Watson?","ACD"
id5498,"what do you want more?","WKL"
id866,"He did not observe any.","ACD"
id1021,"When you pass Bradley’s, would you ask him to send up a       pound of the strongest shag tobacco?","ACD"
id3010,"But—well, can you describe him at all?","ACR"
id5712,"An odd state of things.","WKL"
id3787,"cried Lord Yardly.","ACR"
id4659,"What kind of a row?","ACR"
id4448,"I was a little startled.","ACR"
id5604,"What’s your objection to him?","WKL"
id1849,"My life, at least, is safe.","ACD"
id6083,"He received (thanks once more to his wife) a member of the Royal family among the visitors at his country house in the autumn recess.","WKL"
id2104,"As I saw Lannes's eyes fixed in admiration upon my face it thrilled me to think how splendid was the debut which I was making in the army of Spain.","ACD"
id565,"How did you know what I was doing?","ACD"
id3165,"And, _en passant_, my dear Hastings, she is quite aware of the fact!","ACR"
id6068,"she said.","WKL"
id192,"Challenger!","ACD"
id4577,"No.","ACR"
id3202,"He is too marvellous!","ACR"
id1332,"Watson, Watson, if you are an       honest man you will record this also and set it against my       successes!","ACD"
id2532,"The opinion of other people never interested him in the slightest degree.","ACR"
id1629,"It would have been a heroic death, but who was there to see it or to chronicle it?","ACD"
id786,"Now, Mr. Holmes, we will give you something a little more       recent.","ACD"
id5117,"Let me go--let me go and call--  A look from Mrs. Treverton stopped her before she could utter another word.","WKL"
id4615,"I’d no idea you knew him.","ACR"
id5074,"The clergyman got up from the bedside, frightened, Sarah.","WKL"
id5260,"The misty auburn light that goes before sunrise was flowing up, peaceful and lovely, behind a line of black-brown moorland, over all the eastern sky.","WKL"
id1670,"The steps returned along the passage, and I thought that they were coming for me.","ACD"
id2478,"There is only one man I have ever feared—and he is dead.","ACR"
id2618,"We had a tiny Museum in the village, and the curator and Papa spent most of their days messing about underground and bringing to light portions of woolly rhinoceros and cave bear.","ACR"
id6518,"Change?","WKL"
id4241,"Her conversation, I soon found, was couched in the telegraphic style.","ACR"
id5370,"II.","WKL"
id757,"But at             length some sense came back to their crazed minds, and the             whole of them, thirteen in number, took horse and started             in pursuit.","ACD"
id6157,"Not a hint ever dropped to any living soul, not a word ever spoken to the woman herself, could be produced in proof of the assertion while the woman lived.","WKL"
id5294,"Can she visit it on me from the other world, if I keep the promises I swore to observe, and do no more?","WKL"
id4410,"Evie?","ACR"
id4822,"Both the servants communicated with each other restrainedly, in whispers--sitting close together, and looking round expectantly toward the door whenever the talk flagged between them.","WKL"
id1131,"Nothing of much importance, Mr. Holmes.","ACD"
id3577,"He thinks he’s found a customer for the diamond—an American, sailing for the States to-morrow.","ACR"
id5906,"Whatever the mistake may be, she said, you are responsible for it.","WKL"
id4695,"It’s almost too hot, she murmured.","ACR"

id2092,"You are a brave man, sir, said he.","ACD"
id6866,"The rest, led by Magdalen (who had been Frank’s favorite playfellow in past times) glided back into their old easy habits with him without an effort.","WKL"
id420,"He took my letter from his desk and laid it out before him.","ACD"
id2215,"Te Deum laudamus.","ACD"
id6367,"I think Pope must have had you in his mind when he wrote his famous lines:  Men some to business, some to pleasure take, But every woman is at heart a rake.","WKL"
id3749,"What about the jewel-case?","ACR"
id6831,"But the philosopher’s composure was not to be shaken by any such trifle as the unexpected return of his eldest son.","WKL"
id6666,"It appeared from Mrs. Vanstone’s statement that her mother had been twice married.","WKL"
id1065,"That is Baskerville       Hall in the middle.","ACD"
id6342,"Her headlong course down the house stairs; the brisk activity of all her movements; the incessant sparkle of expression in her face; the enticing gayety which took the hearts of the quietest people by storm—even the reckless delight in bright colors which showed itself in her brilliantly-striped morning dress, in her fluttering ribbons, in the large scarlet rosettes on her smart little shoes—all sprang alike from the same source; from the overflowing physical health which strengthened every muscle, braced every nerve, and set the warm young blood tingling through her veins, like the blood of a growing child.","WKL"
id1256,"They were tan boots and had never been varnished.","ACD"
id1283,"I am very much indebted       to you, Dr. Mortimer, for introducing me to a problem which       presents several interesting alternatives.","ACD"

id1999,"Was it not natural that I should wish to say, Rejoice, my friends, rejoice!","ACD"
id5267,"What must it be made of not to break?","WKL"
id6027,"The lawyer, left alone with the disowned and deserted woman, put the useless certificate silently on the table.","WKL"

id3465,"What?","ACR"
id6463,"What can have happened?","WKL"
id3133,"Take away the overcoat, the beard and the eyeglasses, and there wouldn’t be much to know him by, grumbled the inspector.","ACR"
id4256,"Come and be refreshed.","ACR"
id1987,"However, I did not resent his attitude, for I felt that I had indeed been indiscreet, and that it would give a bad impression if upon this my first evening I quarrelled with my superior officer.","ACD"
id3662,"I mean, you tell Lord Yardly to place himself in your hands and all will be well—and then the diamond vanishes from under your very nose!","ACR"
id6694,"Her object in accompanying her husband to London was to see a certain celebrated physician, and to consult him privately on a very delicate and anxious matter connected with the state of her health.","WKL"
id6232,"No sounds but the steady ticking of the clock, and the lumpish snoring of a large dog stretched on a mat outside the dining-room door, disturbed the mysterious morning stillness of hall and staircase.","WKL"
id3862,"Bah!","ACR"
id5329,"But she recovered her resolution immediately.","WKL"
id4868,"It was as thick and soft, it grew as gracefully, as the hair of a young girl; but it was as gray as the hair of an old woman.","WKL"

id744,"It chanced that this Hugo             came to love (if, indeed, so dark a passion may be known             under so bright a name) the daughter of a yeoman who held             lands near the Baskerville estate.","ACD"

id5282,"The south side itself consisted of stables and out-houses, with a ruinous wall in front of them, which, running back eastward at right angles, joined the north side, and so completed the square which the whole outline of the building represented.","WKL"
id3822,"You comprehend she was left much alone in California.","ACR"
id1955,"Lucia, my lovely Lucia, retired into a convent at Murano after the French had left the city, and there she still may be, some gentle lady abbess who has perhaps long forgotten the days when our hearts throbbed together, and when the whole great world seemed so small a thing beside the love which burned in our veins.","ACD"

id1462,"I could not put one before the other, but I do none an injustice when I say that Lucia was the equal of the best.","ACD"
id6190,"Mr. Vanborough was rich; Mr. Vanborough was well-connected (through his wife); Mr. Van borough was a sound man in every sense of the word; _but_--nobody liked him.","WKL"
id2318,"There I stopped, panting, in the shadow, and, my hand pressed to my side, I tried to collect my scattered senses and to plan out what I should do.","ACD"
id4645,"I didn’t go, she replied abruptly.","ACR"
id2147,"All the way from the frontier I had heard grim tales of torture and mutilation.","ACD"
id6421,"pursued Magdalen, dropping the postman’s character and assuming the daughter’s.","WKL"

id2991,"No, I admitted.","ACR"
id384,"Get quickly out of the room if he seems inclined to be violent.","ACD"
id5269,"They seemed to connect themselves, as every thing else now appeared to connect itself in her mind, with the letter that had been written on Mrs. Treverton's death-bed.","WKL"
id898,"Yes, the wicket-gate which leads on to the moor.","ACD"
id6826,"Thrusting them into one of the pockets of his shooting-jacket, he took the letters out again, at one grasp, to read them when occasion served, later in the day.","WKL"
id5059,"Get it, or I shall not rest in my grave.","WKL"
id3095,"But as I’m a busy man——  I took the hint and rose.","ACR"
id4799,"The convulsions were of a violence terrible to behold.","ACR"
id6915,"Yes, continued Magdalen, answering his blank look of inquiry with perfect composure.","WKL"
id2778,"Then they would go on to servants, and the difficulties of getting good servants and of what they had said to the woman at the Registry Office and of what the woman at the Registry Office had said to them.","ACR"
id4379,"Oh, hundreds!","ACR"
id1439,"I have always been a judge of a horse, and I had a good look at these ones, but I could not see that there was much to be said for them.","ACD"
id3643,"Lady Yardly, aptly ministered to by Poirot, who is as good as a woman in these matters, was sufficiently recovered to be able to tell her story.","ACR"
id5170,"She repeated incessantly such broken phrases as these: How can I give him the letter?--Such a good master; so kind to us all.--Why did she die, and leave it all to _me_?--I can't bear it alone; it's too much for me.","WKL"
id6534,"Look up, both of you, if you please, and listen to me, said Miss Garth.","WKL"
id342,"He's much more likely to do the tickling.","ACD"

id5759,"The lady desired me to present her apologies, Sir.","WKL"
id6338,"The girl’s exuberant vitality asserted itself all over her, from head to foot.","WKL"
id3458,".","ACR"
id5984,"The servant came in.","WKL"
id221,"Recreations: Walking, Alpine climbing.","ACD"
id5281,"Of the many defenses of the place, but one now remained--a heavy, low tower (from which and from the village near, the house derived its name of Porthgenna Tower), standing at the southern extremity of the west front.","WKL"
id3353,"He bowed them both to the door.","ACR"
id6314,"I see you’ve got a headache.","WKL"
id2118,"I will explain.","ACD"
id2880,"Something alarmed him, and he stepped backwards blindly without thinking what he was doing.","ACR"
id69,"I'm in love with somebody else, said she.","ACD"
id606,"I would       suggest, for example, that a presentation to a doctor is more       likely to come from a hospital than from a hunt, and that when       the initials ‘C.C.’ are placed before that hospital the words       ‘Charing Cross’ very naturally suggest themselves.","ACD"
id3949,"But you examined the body?","ACR"
id1307,"We heard the steps of our visitors descend the stair and the bang       of the front door.","ACD"
id672,"Dr. Mortimer blinked through his glasses in mild astonishment.","ACD"
id4742,"What do you think we had better do?","ACR"
id2794,"It was early in January—the 8th, to be exact.","ACR"
id3459,".","ACR"
id2810,"That’s why his overcoat smells so.","ACR"
id3269,"Poirot was watching her narrowly.","ACR"
id1278,"I       suppose that fits into its place.","ACD"
id4408,"Look here, Mary, there’s the deuce of a mess.","ACR"
id4389,"She agrees with me that one must set an example of economy.","ACR"
id2832,"We had all crowded nearer, and an aggrieved porter raised his voice.","ACR"
id2760,"I hadn’t got a straight Grecian nose, or a rosebud mouth, or any of the things you ought to have.","ACR"
id4050,"A gardener who was sweeping up leaves had paused for a minute in his task, and Poirot ran quickly up to him.","ACR"
id2166,"A scaling ladder would not be simpler.","ACD"
id6810,"I won’t give you time; I won’t have any of your special pleading.","WKL"
id3775,"He looked haggard and distraught.","ACR"
id5387,"The elder girl was frail and delicate, with a pale, sensitive face.","WKL"
id5981,"she said.","WKL"
id6466,"exclaimed Magdalen, chafing under a sense of her own injuries.","WKL"
id1022,"Thank you.","ACD"
id5060,"Get it, _or I will come to you from the other world_.","WKL"
id4516,"I received a letter from Evelyn Howard a couple of days after her departure, telling me she was working as a nurse at the big hospital in Middlingham, a manufacturing town some fifteen miles away, and begging me to let her know if Mrs. Inglethorp should show any wish to be reconciled.","ACR"
id2547,"He turned the reporter out of the house with scant ceremony, much to my secret sorrow, as we were particularly short of money at the moment.","ACR"
id5771,"I only wish to say--in case you are thinking of my convenience as your guest--that it will be no nuisance to _me._  The servant impenetrably waited.","WKL"
id3408,"That is what we must find out.","ACR"
id6458,"He absently broke off some morsels of dry toast from the rack near him, absently finished his first cup of tea—then asked for a second, which he left before him untouched.","WKL"
id6000,"she asked.","WKL"
id5612,"III.","WKL"
id1342,"We are dealing with a clever man, Watson.","ACD"
id6337,"The large, electric, light-gray eyes were hardly ever in repose; all varieties of expression followed each other over the plastic, ever-changing face, with a giddy rapidity which left sober analysis far behind in the race.","WKL"
id5776,"If she wants to ask questions, she must go to the agent.","WKL"
id1565,"cried the steward.","ACD"
id6509,"If a stranger had entered the house that day, he might have imagined that an unexpected disaster had happened in it, instead of an unexpected necessity for a journey to London.","WKL"
id5728,"I won’t trouble you to explain yourself, he said.","WKL"
id1686,"I was ushered in, but to my surprise it was not on me that their attention was fixed.","ACD"
id6047,"Still, there she lay senseless.","WKL"
id3623,"That settles it, I breathed.","ACR"
id393,"But don't tell him so, for it makes him very violent.","ACD"
id6305,"I am so sorry, mamma, you were not with us, she said.","WKL"
id6121,"She solemnly repeated the words, I am afraid for my child.","WKL"
id419,"You were good enough to give me an appointment, sir, said I, humbly, producing his envelope.","ACD"
id5037,"She asked first for the smelling-bottle, next for some Eau de Cologne.","WKL"
id3105,"Yes, I’m quite certain of that.","ACR"
id4528,"About a quarter to seven, Mrs. Inglethorp called us that we should be late as supper was early that night.","ACR"
id2952,"I felt my temper stirred.","ACR"
id5720,"He sat with his lips fast closed and his eyes riveted on the table, thinking.","WKL"
id2974,"Young ladies are romantic, I know—fond of mysteries and such-like.","ACR"
id3937,"I understand that he had had considerable losses of late, said Poirot, watching the doctor narrowly.","ACR"
id6542,"Magdalen, suppose you leave off tying your handkerchief into knots and use your fingers on the keys of the piano instead?","WKL"
id812,"Halfway down this walk there is a gate which leads out on             to the moor.","ACD"
id5794,"She was tall and elegant; beautifully dressed, in the happiest combination of simplicity and splendor.","WKL"
id3708,"I shook my head sadly.","ACR"
id1685,"I was led up the stone stair and back into that gorgeous chamber in which I had left the secret tribunal.","ACD"
id1239,"Well, it depends upon what you think worth reporting.","ACD"
id6847,"His hands had the same wandering habit as his eyes; they were constantly changing from one position to another, constantly twisting and turning any little stray thing they could pick up.","WKL"
id3671,"_Mon Dieu!_ It is that in this country you treat the affairs gastronomic with a criminal indifference.","ACR"
id1907,"But he suddenly drew himself straight and stood motionless.","ACD"
id1833,"You need not fear to tell me, dear, for you will find that I am worthy to be loved by such a soldier.","ACD"
id4364,"For my sins.","ACR"
id1343,"This matter cuts very       deep, and though I have not finally made up my mind whether it is       a benevolent or a malevolent agency which is in touch with us, I       am conscious always of power and design.","ACD"
id5832,"Mrs. Vanborough was not only visible--but audible--in the garden; giving her orders to one of the out-of-door servants with the tone and manner which proclaimed the mistress of the house.","WKL"
id1592,"A group of armed men--rough-looking rascals--were standing round the door, and amid them facing the dais was a young fellow in the uniform of the light infantry.","ACD"
id6940,"I don’t know how.","WKL"
id62,"What can I do to mend it?","ACD"
id3630,"It’s not locked now.","ACR"
id1073,"Here are two moorland farmhouses,       High Tor and Foulmire.","ACD"
id3639,"He cannot have gone far as yet.","ACR"
id5497,"Man alive!","WKL"
id2882,"That I don’t know.","ACR"
id3029,"The particulars of several were given to her, including those of the Mill House.","ACR"
id5798,"I am ashamed to disturb you.","WKL"
id5122,"Sarah sprang to the door, opened it, and called into the passage for help; then ran back to the bedside, caught up the sheet of note-paper on which she had written from her mistress's dictation, and hid it in her bosom.","WKL"
id4349,"Oh, there’s Cynthia!","ACR"
id2064,"I could see his dilemma.","ACD"
id4239,"I had an impression of very blue eyes in a sunburnt face.","ACR"
id3079,"A lot of other people may have had too—only they didn’t happen to be killed.","ACR"
id6631,"I shall feel personally obliged if you will honor me by inclosing that card in your letter, he said.","WKL"
id707,"But as a       practical man of affairs it is acknowledged that you stand alone.","ACD"
id172,"To justify my life, Sir.","ACD"
id3085,"He had some loose change in his trousers pocket.","ACR"
id5382,"Mr. Vanborough pushed the bottles in silence to Mr. Kendrew.","WKL"
id5107,"Sarah felt the cold hand that was still laid on hers lifted for a moment--saw it waving gracefully toward her--felt it descend again, and clasp her own hand with a trembling, impatient pressure.","WKL"
id190,"So why should you not try your luck with Professor Challenger, of Enmore Park?","ACD"
id731,"It appears to be a statement of some sort.","ACD"
id2521,"I’d always longed for adventures.","ACR"
id1984,"That night I supped with twenty-six of my new brother-officers, and I fear that in my zeal I showed them only too plainly that I found things very different to what I was accustomed in the army of Germany.","ACD"
id138,"And now I am glad--so glad--if it wakens these thoughts in you!","ACD"
id5386,"But there was no family resemblance between them.","WKL"
id5313,"She placed the keys on a writing-table near her, took up a pen, and rapidly added these lines on the blank side of the letter which she had written under her mistress's dictation--       If this paper should ever be found (which I pray with my      whole heart it never may be), I wish to say that I have      come to the resolution of hiding it, because I dare not      show the writing that it contains to my master, to whom it      is addressed.","WKL"
id5843,"Might I ask one question?","WKL"
id6035,"The law justified it.","WKL"
id11,"We had been friends, quite good friends; but never could I get beyond the same comradeship which I might have established with one of my fellow-reporters upon the Gazette,--perfectly frank, perfectly kindly, and perfectly unsexual.","ACD"
id6428,"He turned over the first four in succession and looked carelessly at the addresses.","WKL"
id1721,"What have you to say to it?","ACD"
id5057,"I won't trust your promise--I'll have your oath.","WKL"
id2001,"I could not say all this.","ACD"
id2939,"I was not so sure.","ACR"
id5093,"then added aloud, with the old stage voice and the old stage gesture: No!","WKL"
id5601,"A man with a career before him, and with courage enough to pursue it.","WKL"
id6285,"They wanted _me_ to go with them last night.","WKL"
id3125,"But I worked it out when I got home, and then I saw why the whole thing had looked so unhandy to me at the time.","ACR"
id541,"said the policeman.","ACD"
id6405,"You are kind to us in everything else, papa; and you make kind allowances for Magdalen’s high spirits—don’t you?","WKL"
id3980,"I looked at him coldly.","ACR"
id4722,"He rose at last, however, and I breathed a sigh of relief.","ACR"
id2694,"It seemed a strangely unsatisfying amount.","ACR"
id6494,"Don’t hold me, Magdalen.","WKL"
id2801,"There were not many people on the platform, and at the extreme end there was only myself and one man.","ACR"
id5596,"I am acquainted with him.","WKL"
id6730,"Was the secret thus far hidden impenetrably, hidden forever?","WKL"
id2785,"I think now, looking back, that I was perhaps a shade intolerant.","ACR"
id3390,"By a perfectly logical process.","ACR"
id1933,"What is this?","ACD"
id3790,"With a dramatic gesture he produced a glittering object.","ACR"
id4614,"He’s a dear little man, said Cynthia.","ACR"
id1254,"The worst of it is that I       only bought the pair last night in the Strand, and I have never       had them on.","ACD"
id3227,"It’s these letters.","ACR"
id1971,"I turned my horse's head in that direction, therefore, and behold me a week or so later at the French headquarters, whence I was directed to the camp of the Hussars of Conflans.","ACD"
id5769,"Just as you please.","WKL"
id1532,"What matter if I have?","ACD"
id5711,"And it is again felony (by yet another law) for a Presbyterian minister and a Non-conformist minister to celebrate a marriage which may be lawfully celebrated by a clergyman of the Established Church.","WKL"
id3656,"No, not here, Mullings, in the library.","ACR"
id4001,"You can rest assured that I will do all in my power to render the matter not too unpleasant for you.","ACR"
id946,"For example?","ACD"
id5244,"Simple as the words were, quietly and tenderly as they were spoken, they seemed instantly to deprive Sarah Leeson of all power of self-control.","WKL"
id5791,"A sound of rustling silk made itself gently audible in the passage outside.","WKL"
id1120,"Might I ask you to hand me my violin, and we       will postpone all further thought upon this business until we       have had the advantage of meeting Dr. Mortimer and Sir Henry       Baskerville in the morning.","ACD"
id3563,"_Vous etes bonne mere_, said Poirot, with a gallant little bow, as the children were removed reluctantly by a stern nurse.","ACR"
id3734,"The clerk merely smiled and remarked that he saw very little difference.","ACR"
id3784,"My little idea was to bring things to a head, explained Poirot placidly.","ACR"
id334,"I asked, triumphantly.","ACD"
id1331,"Was ever such bad luck       and such bad management, too?","ACD"
id6900,"The one thing in the whole universe that I long to do most.","WKL"
id6613,"Out for long?","WKL"
id5043,"The deep flush began to tinge her cheeks once more, and she spoke hurriedly and unsteadily when she handed the pen back to her maid.","WKL"
id5379,"The guest’s name was Kendrew.","WKL"
id1009,"Only one more question, Dr. Mortimer.","ACD"
id4159,"I will therefore briefly set down the circumstances which led to my being connected with the affair.","ACR"
id2543,"That enterprising newspaper, the _Daily Budget,_ being hard up for something spicy, immediately brought itself out with large headlines.","ACR"
id3237,"You have not obeyed.","ACR"
id6569,"Below the hat was a lean, long, sallow face, deeply pitted with the smallpox, and characterized, very remarkably, by eyes of two different colors—one bilious green, one bilious brown, both sharply intelligent.","WKL"
id1903,"I still crouched in the corner, but I was tense in every muscle, like a wild cat about to spring.","ACD"
id4300,"No, before the war I was in Lloyd’s.","ACR"
id999,"What would you recommend?","ACD"
id407,"It was his size which took one's breath away--his size and his imposing presence.","ACD"
id2185,"You will think that it was good shooting in the dark, but these people used trabucos, or blunderbusses, which were filled up with all sorts of stones and scraps of metal, so that they would hit you as certainly as I have hit a pheasant on a branch.","ACD"
id6533,"Her quick observation showed her the necessity for interfering to some practical purpose; and her ready good sense at once pointed the way.","WKL"
id94,"But chances are all around you.","ACD"
id279,"Well, I'm a bacteriologist, you know.","ACD"
id3248,"I see, madame, that you believe the diamond referred to to be——  ‘The Western Star,’ finished Miss Marvell.","ACR"
id6215,"It really began to look like something of the sort.","WKL"
id789,"My friend leaned a little forward and his expression became       intent.","ACD"
id4994,"Sarah went to the cabinet and opened it; then stopped, as if some sudden suspicion had crossed her mind, and asked what the writing materials were wanted for.","WKL"
id3558,"Lord Yardly had his cue.","ACR"
id2510,"A rather peculiar smile played over the dancer’s face.","ACR"
id5944,"Have you been falsely presenting yourself to the world--falsely presenting yourself to _me_--in the character and with the aspirations of a single man?","WKL"
id5522,"It’s nearly two years since you broke up your establishment abroad, and came to England on your father’s death.","WKL"

id6994,"Ladies read the part of Lucy; remarked that she appeared to great advantage in the first half of the play, and faded out of it altogether in the latter half; objected to pass from the notice of the audience in that manner, when all the rest had a chance of distinguishing themselves to the end; shut up the book, apologized, and retired.","WKL"

id6801,"Done!","WKL"
id2935,"Such were the details published broadcast by the _Daily Budget,_ and Find the Man in the Brown Suit was their daily war-cry.","ACR"
id2320,"It was two o'clock.","ACD"
id5997,"It was a marriage-certificate.","WKL"
id3599,"The switches were just outside the door.","ACR"
id4293,"Miss Howard, in particular, took no pains to conceal her feelings.","ACR"
id3250,"At the time, Gregory remembers that there was some story attached to the stone, but the Chink wasn’t handing out any information.","ACR"
id4058,"A glimpse of a black-robed figure on the terrace at the side of the house, and our quarry swerved and we after him, so that we were witnesses of the meeting.","ACR"
id1076,"This, then, is the stage       upon which tragedy has been played, and upon which we may help to       play it again.","ACD"

id2173,"I had but to climb along a stout limb in order to reach the wall.","ACD"
id4085,"Now, you were here just before the occurrence, and can give us equally valuable information.","ACR"
id5799,"One look at the room will be quite enough.","WKL"
id6373,"said Magdalen, taking Mr. Vanstone as boisterously round the neck as if he belonged to some larger order of Newfoundland dog, and was made to be romped with at his daughter’s convenience.","WKL"
id1881,"At the same time my pain and my rage were always soothed by the reflection that I had suffered for the woman whom I loved.","ACD"
id3013,"Take away the overcoat, the beard and the eyeglasses, and there wouldn’t be much to know him by, grumbled the inspector.","ACR"
id5466,"What _can_ be the matter with you?","WKL"
id4988,"Mrs. Treverton shuddered, and drew them up to their former position, close round her neck.","WKL"
id1213,"Did the composer fear an interruption—and       from whom?","ACD"
id3168,"But you get no marks for that, Poirot.","ACR"

id5940,"Lady Jane looked at Mr. Vanborough--at Mr. Vanborough, whom she loved; whom she had honestly believed to be a single man; whom she had suspected, up to that moment, of nothing worse than of trying to screen the frailties of his friend.","WKL"
id4225,"He checked the car suddenly, and glanced at his watch.","ACR"
id4197,"He turned up from nowhere, on the pretext of being a second cousin or something of Evie’s, though she didn’t seem particularly keen to acknowledge the relationship.","ACR"
id3057,"The accident in the Tube, dismissed as a coincidence, faded out of the public mind.","ACR"
id4559,"This should have been sent up this morning.","ACR"

id1351,"My dear Watson, clumsy as I have been, you surely do not       seriously imagine that I neglected to get the number?","ACD"
id4527,"After tea, Mrs. Inglethorp went to lie down to rest before her efforts in the evening and I challenged Mary Cavendish to a single at tennis.","ACR"
id6515,"thought Miss Garth, pondering over Mrs. Vanstone’s vague explanatory words.","WKL"
id1643,"Three of the sides of my prison were formed of stone, but the fourth was of wood, and I could see that it had only recently been erected.","ACD"

id3470,"What I do now is for my own satisfaction—the satisfaction of Hercule Poirot!","ACR"
id4908,"Inside the room the one audible sound was the slow, toilsome breathing of the dying woman, raising itself in its mortal frailness, awfully and distinctly, even through the far thunder-breathing from the bosom of the everlasting sea.","WKL"
id1255,"If you have never worn them, why did you put them out to be       cleaned?","ACD"
id1404,"There are ten       shillings over in case of emergencies.","ACD"
id3166,"I laughed.","ACR"
id6587,"And the two young ladies, he went on, the two young ladies who were walking with you are doubtless Mr. Vanstone’s daughters?","WKL"

id2169,"Girding up the heavy brown gown, I ascended the tree as directed.","ACD"

id5332,"ON a summer’s morning, between thirty and forty years ago, two girls were crying bitterly in the cabin of an East Indian passenger ship, bound outward, from Gravesend to Bombay.","WKL"
id494,"Expensive, but very necessary.","ACD"
id6243,"The housemaid came down—tall and slim, with the state of the spring temperature written redly on her nose.","WKL"
id3901,"I said, much interested.","ACR"
id3825,"But _au fond_, he is very business-like, _ce monsieur_!","ACR"

id4554,"We had just put away the last tea-spoon when a knock came at the door.","ACR"
id5470,"Is it business?","WKL"
id1946,"I forgive you, for if you have wronged me you have made a noble atonement.","ACD"
id930,"He had left his own marks all over that small patch of gravel.","ACD"
id1237,"We are coming to that.","ACD"
id733,"But I understand that it is something more modern and practical       upon which you wish to consult me?","ACD"
id2022,"May I ask, sir, said I to the major, at what hour the regiment is paraded?","ACD"
id3012,"He had a dark pointed beard and gold-rimmed eyeglasses.","ACR"
id6448,"she asked.","WKL"
id6606,"What may your commands be, if you please?","WKL"
id5818,"An invalid friend of mine wants a furnished house at Hampstead.","WKL"
id318,"You'll find paper there.","ACD"
id5828,"She looked round, and appealed to Mr. Vanborough.","WKL"
id6378,"The girls enjoyed themselves amazingly, my dear, he continued, addressing his wife.","WKL"
id4321,"He used to say that all good detective work was a mere matter of method.","ACR"
id1672,"I heard the steps die away up the stair.","ACD"
id5535,"Thirteen years ago I fell in love with a handsome public singer, and married her.","WKL"
id6222,"The Ministry declined to take No for an answer.","WKL"
id4807,"For one instant he stopped dead, staring at the figure on the bed, and, at the same instant, Mrs. Inglethorp cried out in a strangled voice, her eyes fixed on the doctor:  Alfred—Alfred—— Then she fell back motionless on the pillows.","ACR"
id5115,"You drank it all, she cried, starting to her feet, as she comprehended the meaning of that gesture.","WKL"
id5129,"The nurse, approaching to draw the curtains together, started at the sight of her face, and turned to the doctor.","WKL"
id385,"Don't wait to argue with him.","ACD"
id243,"I walked across to the Savage Club, but instead of turning into it I leaned upon the railings of Adelphi Terrace and gazed thoughtfully for a long time at the brown, oily river.","ACD"
id3092,"In fact, inspector, you are determined to find nothing odd, I said sweetly.","ACR"
id6103,"The one thing certain was the fact--account for it as you might.","WKL"
id3405,"It is true that they came by post, but there is a curious perfume impregnating them—something in the nature of joss-stick—that at once suggested the East to me.","ACR"
id3600,"As she stretched out her hand to them, the incredible thing happened.","ACR"
id248,"But these recriminations, twice mentioned in his skeleton biography, could only mean that he was a fanatic in science.","ACD"
id6780,"You and your wife are excellent people, he used to say to Mr. Vanstone.","WKL"
id2508,"It is necessary.","ACR"
id5813,"For the moment nobody was visible on the lawn.","WKL"
id2612,"He returned late that evening, and, to my dismay, I saw his muffler and overcoat were missing.","ACR"
id2367,"To-night you have surpassed yourself.","ACR"
id4203,"No doubt the fellow was very useful to her.","ACR"
id2030,"There remained the major, four captains, and seven lieutenants.","ACD"
id6371,"If you’re all rakes, Miss Garth, the sexes are turned topsy-turvy with a vengeance; and the men will have nothing left for it but to stop at home and darn the stockings.—Let’s have some breakfast.","WKL"
id4155,"Black was straightforward enough over the matter.","ACR"
id3950,"Certainly.","ACR"
id344,"Well, good-bye.","ACD"
id1044,"There is a delightful       freshness about you, Watson, which makes it a pleasure to       exercise any small powers which I possess at your expense.","ACD"
id3765,"He discounted further inquiries by slipping his arm through mine.","ACR"
id3869,"_Pas du tout_, said Poirot briskly.","ACR"
id714,"Early eighteenth century, unless it is a forgery.","ACD"
id448,"I alluded merely to the trend of modern thought and the general scientific point of view, if I might so express it.","ACD"
id3501,"Poirot smiled a little, but made no direct reply.","ACR"
id5190,"The curtain waved slowly to and fro for the second time.","WKL"
id3318,"According to this, the stone was once the right eye of a temple god.","ACR"
id3241,"The first letter I treated as a joke, explained Miss Marvell.","ACR"
id2672,"He came down specially from town to see me.","ACR"
id915,"Then anyone could have got over it?","ACD"
id6437,"She returned, accordingly, to her place at the breakfast-table.","WKL"
id6609,"How is she?","WKL"
id5995,"It speaks for itself.","WKL"
id2412,"It is rather—upsetting for all of us.","ACR"
id4543,"I exclaimed, as my eye travelled round the small room.","ACR"
id4243,"Can’t keep even with ’em.","ACR"
id5616,"A man of rare ability; a man of unblemished honor (as the code of the world goes); but not a man to be taken familiarly by the hand.","WKL"
id2242,"It thrilled me with horror, that terrible voice, but it thrilled me also with hope, for it was the voice of a Frenchman.","ACD"
id3873,"She jumped at the chance your words offered.","ACR"
id589,"He now took the stick from my hands       and examined it for a few minutes with his naked eyes.","ACD"
id4098,"The usual odd topics.","ACR"
id6668,"Mrs. Wragge had left no family by her first husband; and had afterward married Mrs. Vanstone’s father.","WKL"
id2976,"The man in the corner raised a meek voice.","ACR"
id4240,"She was a pleasant-looking woman of about forty, with a deep voice, almost manly in its stentorian tones, and had a large sensible square body, with feet to match—these last encased in good thick boots.","ACR"
id6976,"Innocent and fatal delusion!","WKL"
id6009,"I decline to do more.","WKL"
id4745,"It was obviously locked or bolted on the inside.","ACR"
id2460,"Very clever, interpolated the Count approvingly.","ACR"
id983,"It seems natural, does it not?","ACD"
id6896,"said Mr. Vanstone, without a moment’s hesitation.","WKL"
id4028,"I am very stupid over business things.","ACR"
id5758,"The machine had a message to deliver, and delivered it.","WKL"
id4690,"He poured it out, and went out of the room carrying it carefully.","ACR"
id4298,"From the very first I took a firm and rooted dislike to him, and I flatter myself that my first judgments are usually fairly shrewd.","ACR"
id6235,"As the clock pointed to a quarter to seven, the dog woke and shook himself.","WKL"
id5459,"Mr. Vanborough’s sullen humor resisted his friend as obstinately as it had resisted his wife.","WKL"
id4803,"In vain Mary and John tried to administer more brandy.","ACR"
id1375,"Yes, sir, he is still with us.","ACD"
id2596,"I haven’t got any ready money.","ACR"
id6226,"And the friends of the family rubbed their hands and said, What did we tell you?","WKL"
id5404,"They said Blanche’s health required English air.","WKL"
id4515,"They were elicited subsequently at the trial by a process of long and tedious cross-examinations.","ACR"
id2188,"Perhaps he thought that he would like to finish of this accursed Frenchman, or perhaps he had a desire to see what was in his pockets; but whatever his motive, he laid down his gun, leaned forward, and swung himself into the tree.","ACD"
id4786,"The still feebly flickering ashes in the grate, and the row of prim ornaments on the mantelpiece, were surely harmless enough.","ACR"
id81,"Well, in the first place, I don't think my ideal would speak like that, said she.","ACD"
id6624,"A thousand thanks!","WKL"
id6295,"There, in the daughter’s cheek, glowed the lovely dusky red which had faded from the mother’s to bloom again no more.","WKL"
id5109,"Swear that you will not take this paper away with you, if you leave the house, after I am dead.","WKL"
id1325,"At that instant I was aware of a bushy black beard and a pair of       piercing eyes turned upon us through the side window of the cab.","ACD"
id5591,"Who is the person?","WKL"
id1297,"Suppose you and your friend, Dr. Watson,       come round and lunch with us at two.","ACD"
id1039,"You have been at your club all day, I       perceive.","ACD"
id2446,"You said just now that none of us had anything on the chief.","ACR"
id841,"Within the last few months it became increasingly plain to me       that Sir Charles’s nervous system was strained to the breaking       point.","ACD"
id3190,"And others share that opinion—even, if I mistake not, Miss Mary Marvell.","ACR"
id3941,"It is fortunate for his wife, then, that there is this life insurance.","ACR"
id6868,"Even the account he was now encouraged to give of the reception accorded to him by his father, on the previous night, failed to disturb Norah’s gravity.","WKL"
id4468,"Miss Howard was swallowed up in an eager chorus of protests and good-byes.","ACR"
id2418,"I attribute much of his success to that—and to his invariable plan of providing a suitable scapegoat.","ACR"
id3569,"At that moment the butler entered with a telegram on a salver which he handed to Lord Yardly.","ACR"
id1366,"And so could I—from which I gather that in all probability it       was a false one.","ACD"
id6895,"A ball!","WKL"
id2836,"I felt that it was too horrible.","ACR"
id6454,"She looked at him with an incredulous surprise, which would have been irresistibly absurd under less serious circumstances.","WKL"
id4888,"The room in which Mrs. Treverton lay dying was on the floor beneath.","WKL"
id427,"Your age and appearance make your support doubly valuable.","ACD"
id1441,"However, they were the only four horses, alive or dead, in the whole town, so it was not to be expected that the people would know any better.","ACD"
id634,"Mortimer, James, M.R.C.S., 1882, Grimpen, Dartmoor, Devon.","ACD"
id6184,"Being a landed gentleman, the defendant had only to issue the necessary orders--and behold, Mr. Delamayn was in Parliament!","WKL"
id6031,"Yes!","WKL"
id2934,"Nothing much there to go upon.","ACR"
id2989,"But some one might have been walking up the platform towards us—some one he recognized.","ACR"
id3691,"In the morning Poirot seemed strangely disinclined to stir out.","ACR"
id1179,"cried Sir       Henry.","ACD"
id4417,"At any rate, she burst out, I’ve spoken my mind!","ACR"
id4397,"Some violent emotion seemed to be mastering him.","ACR"
id5714,"In this country we don’t appear to mind it.","WKL"
id5751,"Mr. Vanborough looked up at the man with a sudden outbreak of anger.","WKL"
id3007,"He was reaching slowly for pen and paper.","ACR"
id3926,"We passed up the path and rang the bell.","ACR"
id5965,"A profligate single man is shocking--but reclaimable.","WKL"
id599,"Not that you are entirely wrong in this       instance.","ACD"
id5127,"Go to your master, he said, and beg him to wait in his own room until I can come and speak to him.","WKL"
id4096,"Now what was the talk about at dinner on Tuesday night?","ACR"
id3504,"Then you think there’s actually something in these wild-cat tales?","ACR"
id1846,"Go back!","ACD"
id6462,"When an easy-tempered man does assert himself in his family, the rarity of the demonstration invariably has its effect; and the will of that easy-tempered man is Law.","WKL"
id2261,"At the first flash a man seemed to be floating in the air in front of me, and I dropped the box in my amazement.","ACD"
id5730,"You have given me a lesson, Sir, which I shall not forget.","WKL"
id3416,"At last Lady Yardly rose.","ACR"
id1178,"Well, if that isn’t smart!","ACD"
id2117,"I asked.","ACD"
id4596,"This is my old friend, Monsieur Poirot, whom I have not seen for years.","ACR"
id6784,"In later years, when Frank had reached the age of seventeen, the same curious shifting of the relative positions of parent and friend between the two neighbors was exemplified more absurdly than ever.","WKL"
id2789,"As yet, I had not been successful in finding a post.","ACR"
id1613,"His name is Gerard, said the little steward at the door.","ACD"
id2873,"The bureau clerk from the hotel identified the man as having arrived the day before and booked a room under that name.","ACR"
id3499,"Still, the stone _is_ known as ‘The Star of the East.’  Well, what if it is?","ACR"
id2083,"Within, there was a labyrinth of passages formed among the debris of the houses which had been destroyed by the mines of the engineers.","ACD"
id3520,"Lord Yardly nodded.","ACR"
id2787,"My affairs did not progress very fast.","ACR"
id4626,"Then catching sight of Dorcas, the parlourmaid, going into the dining-room, she called to her to bring some stamps into the boudoir.","ACR"
id4051,"Tell me, I pray you, who is that gentleman?","ACR"
id515,"The watchful Austin had thrown open the hall door.","ACD"
id3570,"The latter tore it open with a brief word of apology.","ACR"
id6781,"I respect your honest prejudices in favor of those boys of mine with all my heart.","WKL"
id4175,"I recalled her as an energetic, autocratic personality, somewhat inclined to charitable and social notoriety, with a fondness for opening bazaars and playing the Lady Bountiful.","ACR"
id6496,"There, there, my love, let me go.","WKL"
id5150,"One of the silent, secret sort.","WKL"
id2558,"I yearned for adventure, for love, for romance, and I seemed condemned to an existence of drab utility.","ACR"
id1146,"Out of the envelope he took a half-sheet of foolscap       paper folded into four.","ACD"
id2683,"My dear child, do you think you can listen to me whilst I try to make a few things clear to you?","ACR"
id3428,"It had become rather a pose with him to consistently belittle my abilities, and I think he was chagrined at finding no loophole for criticism.","ACR"
id1129,"Pray take a seat, Sir Henry.","ACD"
id5347,"Anne was to wait at home until the first opportunity offered of sending her cheaply to Milan.","WKL"
id5610,"He was there at that moment.","WKL"
id181,"You could show him up as the liar that he is!","ACD"
id1908,"At the same instant there came a confused murmuring sound through the little window far above my head.","ACD"
id2718,"That is settled then.","ACR"
id4558,"Cynthia took the bottle and examined it with the severity of a judge.","ACR"
id2771,"Anna the Adventuress, I said aloud, nodding at my reflection.","ACR"
id2440,"And why do you think that I go?","ACR"
id963,"Then, how can I assist you?","ACD"
id3310,"We both pleaded guilty rather shamefacedly.","ACR"
id4845,"Sarah is not in the housekeeper's room, said Mathew, returning to his fellow-servant in the kitchen.","WKL"
id5937,"But this I do know--I won’t submit to be insulted in my own house.","WKL"
id4257,"Well, said Miss Howard, drawing off her gardening gloves, I’m inclined to agree with you.","ACR"
id2251,"I put up my hands, but they felt only empty air.","ACD"
id1034,"No, it’s this poisonous atmosphere.","ACD"
id638,"‘Do We Progress?’ (_Journal of         Psychology_, March, 1883).","ACD"
id6471,"I have no secrets from papa—what business has papa to have secrets from me!","WKL"
id3363,"I shall not be long.","ACR"
id2540,"He had read a paper before some society on the subject of the young of the chimpanzee.","ACR"
id1061,"A large-scale map, I presume?","ACD"
id3726,"Rolf nodded to us as we entered.","ACR"
id5780,"In the garden, or the paddock, Sir--I am not sure which.","WKL"
id5936,"I am innocently involved in some vile deception which I don’t understand.","WKL"
id1318,"He quickened his pace until we had decreased the distance which       divided us by about half.","ACD"
id5723,"You mean to tell me that, foreseeing the present interview and the result to which it might lead, you felt any doubt as to the course you were bound to take?","WKL"
id3526,"Oh, she’s bitterly opposed to my selling the jewel.","ACR"
id6348,"The name had been borne by one of Mr. Vanstone’s sisters, who had died in early youth; and, in affectionate remembrance of her, he had called his second daughter by it—just as he had called his eldest daughter Norah, for his wife’s sake.","WKL"
id1446,"For myself I had plenty to do, and I never found the time heavy on my hands.","ACD"
id5762,"Hold your tongue, and tell the lady to go to the devil!","WKL"
id5858,"At the same moment (still supposing that Mr. Delamayn was the master of the house) Lady Jane returned to the charge.","WKL"
id446,"He spoke with a menacing calm.","ACD"
id3157,"What does the great detective say?","ACR"
id173,"Dear me, Mr. Malone, this is very--very exalted.","ACD"
id3766,"Come, come, _mon ami_.","ACR"
id3088,"I tried another tack.","ACR"
id2657,"Miss Anne, you are very much of a child still.","ACR"
id2184,"The Spaniard had seen him standing under the tree and had shot him.","ACD"
id1509,"I cannot tell you the humiliation and also the fury which filled my mind as I lay there like a helpless sheep being carried to the butcher's.","ACD"
id1038,"Open the window, then!","ACD"
id3978,"I glanced at him uneasily, but he seemed perfectly serious.","ACR"
id2518,"Very fortunately, too, the gaps that I cannot supply from my own knowledge are amply covered by Sir Eustace Pedler’s diary, of which he has kindly begged me to make use.","ACR"
id2271,"he whispered.","ACD"
id6403,"Exactly what I have said myself, till I am tired of repeating it, remarked Miss Garth.","WKL"
id1712,"You are Frenchmen.","ACD"
id5927,"Who is that woman?","WKL"
id3321,"Then, in triumph shall they return to the god.’ It is a curious coincidence that there is at the present time a stone corresponding closely in description with this one, and known as ‘the Star of the West,’ or ‘the Western Star.’ It is the property of the celebrated film actress, Miss Mary Marvell.","ACR"
id3370,"My heart gave a leap as I recognized her.","ACR"
id267,"There were one or two folk who were inclined to take him seriously, but he soon choked them off.","ACD"
id6695,"In plainer terms still, this anxious matter meant nothing less than the possibility that she might again become a mother.","WKL"
id2916,"Mrs. James described him as tall and broad-shouldered, with a bronzed face and light grey eyes.","ACR"
id1143,"There was no possible indication that we intended to go to this       hotel.","ACD"
id1579,"I reached it well in front of them, and I gave a shout of triumph as the handle turned freely in my hand, for I could see that it led to the outside and that all was clear for my escape.","ACD"
id911,"Was the wicket-gate       closed?","ACD"
id2066,"Sir, said I, may I be permitted to make a suggestion?","ACD"

id4785,"I instinctively followed the direction of his eyes, but I could see nothing unusual.","ACR"
id6513,"Even Miss Garth felt the all-pervading influence of the household disorganization, and sat alone by the morning-room fire, with her head shaking ominously, and her work laid aside.","WKL"
id1026,"I therefore spent the day at my club and did not return to Baker       Street until evening.","ACD"
id3702,"What?","ACR"
id5527,"I have reason to know that you are actually believed to be a single man, among these new acquaintances of yours, in more than one quarter.","WKL"
id6406,"said the quiet Norah, taking her father’s part and her sister’s with so little show of resolution on the surface that few observers would have been sharp enough to detect the genuine substance beneath it.","WKL"
id2334,"It was only here in Spain that we learned how terrible a thing it is to fight against a people.","ACD"
id3061,"In each there was a man with a tanned face—evidently an Englishman living abroad, and there were other things.","ACR"
id2611,"In a few minutes Papa stalked off, correctly booted and well mufflered.","ACR"
id976,"He came of the old masterful Baskerville       strain and was the very image, they tell me, of the family       picture of old Hugo.","ACD"
id6447,"What _is_ the matter, papa?","WKL"
id4116,"Name, said Poirot.","ACR"
id590,"Then with       an expression of interest he laid down his cigarette, and       carrying the cane to the window, he looked over it again with a       convex lens.","ACD"
id1288,"Well, that is what we have to find out.","ACD"
id5512,"Let us change the subject.","WKL"
id2081,"I had expected that the colonel would at once inform me what it was that I had been chosen to do, but instead of that he walked on in silence, I following behind him.","ACD"
id5271,"Still in my hands!","WKL"
id3811,"The two diamonds, supposed to be so miraculously alike—bah!","ACR"
id4561,"She forgot.","ACR"
id920,"Did no one examine?","ACD"
id1930,"You French coxcomb.","ACD"
id1471,"It is a good wine, and a second bottle cannot hurt.","ACD"
id16,"Even in my short life I had learned as much as that--or had inherited it in that race memory which we call instinct.","ACD"
id6173,"The rising solicitor was struck off the roll, at his own request--and entered himself as a student at one of the Inns of Court.","WKL"
id6076,"In three months from the memorable day when his solicitor had informed him that he was a free man, Mr. Vanborough possessed the wife he desired, to grace the head of his table and to push his fortunes in the world--the Legislature of Great Britain being the humble servant of his treachery, and the respectable accomplice of his crime.","WKL"
id5380,"It was the end of the dinner.","WKL"
id4644,"I asked, trying to appear as indifferent as I could.","ACR"
id4025,"By the way, do you know anything of your husband’s financial position?","ACR"
id3224,"Poirot beamed encouragement.","ACR"
id4099,"Maltravers asked after my people, and then we discussed the question of German reparations, and then Mrs. Maltravers asked a lot of questions about East Africa, and I told them one or two yarns, that’s about all, I think.","ACR"
id2886,"The man might have seen a cat.","ACR"
id4566,"Well, said Cynthia graciously, we are very busy, but if we have time it shall be done.","ACR"
id1649,"Two planks were badly joined, and so loose that I was certain I could easily detach them.","ACD"
id1967,"At the time I speak of I was only twenty-five years of age, as reckless and desperate a man as any in that great army.","ACD"
id5705,"exclaimed Mr. Kendrew.","WKL"
id5865,"At that moment Mrs. Vanborough appeared on the garden side of the window.","WKL"
id1677,"Closing the two loose planks behind me I returned to my own cell and waited there with all the courage which I could command for the summons which would probably be my death knell.","ACD"
id869,"Footprints.","ACD"
id2664,"I have another proposal to make.","ACR"
id1037,"It is intolerable.","ACD"
id5554,"To come to the point, he said--a woman like Lady Jane Parnell.","WKL"
id1243,"But I       hope that to lose one of your boots is not part of the ordinary       routine of life over here.","ACD"
id3688,"I had my way with Poirot, however, and we departed immediately, leaving behind us a note of explanation and apology for Lord Yardly.","ACR"
id4582,"He was the opposite of his brother in almost every respect, being unusually shy and reserved.","ACR"
id4211,"John Cavendish was waiting on the platform, and piloted me out to the car.","ACR"
id3375,"A very different type, this, from Miss Mary Marvell.","ACR"
id4046,"Still, life is full of discrepancies, and assuredly the man cannot have taken his own life—there is no poison that would fill his mouth with blood.","ACR"
id3607,"It was some minutes before we could find it.","ACR"
id2569,"I came down one morning to find Papa excited to the point of apoplexy.","ACR"
id643,"It is my experience that it is       only an amiable man in this world who receives testimonials, only       an unambitious one who abandons a London career for the country,       and only an absent-minded one who leaves his stick and not his       visiting-card after waiting an hour in your room.","ACD"
id4168,"Your mother keeps well?","ACR"
id522,"You infernal bully!","ACD"
id5868,"This lady appears to be an old friend of yours.","WKL"
id1536,"Tut!","ACD"
id45,"It's love.","ACD"
id1795,"No, no, a young dark man.","ACD"
id367,"he asked.","ACD"
id6645,"The name and address of the clerical-looking stranger (both written in pencil) ran as follows:  _Captain Wragge.","WKL"
id4494,"It’ll be mine some day—should be mine now by rights, if my father had only made a decent will.","ACR"
id6852,"This, after three years’ trial, being the conviction on both sides, the master had thought it the most straightforward course for the pupil to go home and candidly place results before his father and his friends.","WKL"
id5124,"That moment passed, and, with the next, the shadow which goes before the presence of death stole up and shut out the light of life in one quiet instant from all the face.","WKL"
id1887,"You had best fetch a surgeon or you will find her dead in the morning.","ACD"
id6627,"He was not in the least affected by the severity of Miss Garth’s looks and language—he was simply relieved by her proposal, and he showed it with the most engaging sincerity.","WKL"
id290,"Can't you tell me the point?","ACD"
id4655,"To which Mary Cavendish replied, with a rising bitterness:  Of course, I might have known you would shield him.","ACR"
id3863,"said Poirot brutally.","ACR"
id3472,"And you calmly wire Lord Yardly to dash up to town just to suit your convenience.","ACR"
id2511,"I am quite sure of him.","ACR"
id3613,"Lord Yardly sprang up with an oath.","ACR"
id269,"Well, by his insufferable rudeness and impossible behavior.","ACD"
id3277,"A magnificent stone—without a flaw.","ACR"
id4782,"Never have I seen such a ghastly look on any man’s face.","ACR"
id4262,"Her tall, slender form, outlined against the bright light; the vivid sense of slumbering fire that seemed to find expression only in those wonderful tawny eyes of hers, remarkable eyes, different from any other woman’s that I have ever known; the intense power of stillness she possessed, which nevertheless conveyed the impression of a wild untamed spirit in an exquisitely civilised body—all these things are burnt into my memory.","ACR"
id1745,"I had been forgotten during this episode, and though I am not a man who is accustomed to being overlooked I should have been all the happier had they continued to neglect me.","ACD"
id5160,"There was the address: To my Husband; there the first blotted line beneath, in her dead mistress's handwriting; there the lines that followed, traced by her own pen, with the signature at the end--Mrs. Treverton's first, and then her own.","WKL"
id293,"Would you care to come?","ACD"
id417,"What now?","ACD"
id97,"I've never met him, and yet I seem to know him so well.","ACD"
id122,"I dare say I am merely a foolish woman with a young girl's fancies.","ACD"
id3214,"Their marriage had taken place about a year ago in the States and this was their first visit to England.","ACR"
id4333,"They’d know.","ACR"
id6442,"Miss Garth alone observed the effect which that change produced on the attentive mistress of the house.","WKL"
id6246,"Last of all, the footman appeared, yawning disconsolately; the living picture of a man who felt that he had been defrauded of his fair night’s rest.","WKL"
id4913,"Sarah lit two candles with a wavering hand--placed them hesitatingly on a table by the bedside--waited for a moment, looking all round her with suspicious timidity--then undrew the curtains.","WKL"
id6464,"whispered Norah, as they closed the breakfast-room door and crossed the hall.","WKL"
id455,"Why, surely!","ACD"
id3857,"Also a few more little lies which occurred to me.","ACR"
id5830,"she asked, and, on this occasion, waited for a reply.","WKL"
id3567,"Poirot bowed again.","ACR"
id4441,"For a moment we sat and stared at her.","ACR"
id3603,"cried Lord Yardly.","ACR"
id2431,"Doubtless, now that he has—retired, he will marry.","ACR"
id935,"It is evidently a case of       extraordinary interest, and one which presented immense       opportunities to the scientific expert.","ACD"
id4625,"What should there be?","ACR"
id2970,"A busy medical man very often doesn’t read the papers.","ACR"
id6426,"Let’s go to-morrow night!","WKL"
id6539,"I have just ordered an excellent dinner at the customary hour.","WKL"
id3850,"Her hand concealed the part of it where the gap would have shown.","ACR"
id568,"But, tell me, Watson, what do you make of       our visitor’s stick?","ACD"
id4387,"We have given up late dinner for some time now.","ACR"
id2109,"The engineer officer rose, his compasses in his hand.","ACD"
id2180,"I was so astonished at this sudden crash at my very elbow that I nearly fell out of the tree.","ACD"
id180,"What about exposing a fraud--a modern Munchausen--and making him rideeculous?","ACD"
id5534,"What are the facts?","WKL"
id3169,"It was a mere matter of recognition.","ACR"
id6256,"Vanstone showed his character on the surface of him freely to all men.","WKL"
id1858,"Go into my cell.","ACD"
id686,"You interest me very much,       Mr. Holmes.","ACD"
id6957,"Few men of forty would have resisted her at that moment.","WKL"
id649,"He had risen and paced the room as he spoke.","ACD"
id2133,"Hubert lives in a small house between a cobbler's and a wine-shop, on the right-hand side as you go from the cathedral.","ACD"
id6977,"It is one thing in private society to set up the stage and choose the play—it is another thing altogether to find the actors.","WKL"
id1274,"But as to my uncle’s death—well, it all seems       boiling up in my head, and I can’t get it clear yet.","ACD"
id3065,"Inspector Meadows was a small man with a ginger head and what I considered a peculiarly irritating manner.","ACR"
id2006,"At last, after my tale of how I had guided the army across the Danube, one universal shout of laughter broke from them all.","ACD"
id5307,"She started; a faint flush of color flew into her cheeks, and she hastily advanced closer to the wall of the house.","WKL"
id6018,"He is _not_ married.","WKL"
id6644,"Miss Garth looked down at the card in her hand, and looked up again in blank astonishment.","WKL"
id4533,"The following morning, Mrs. Inglethorp stayed in bed to breakfast, as she was rather overtired; but she appeared in her briskest mood about 12.30, and swept Lawrence and myself off to a luncheon party.","ACR"
id2793,"My theory was about to be proved in practice.","ACR"
id2252,"Where are you?","ACD"
id6142,"don’t let her sing!","WKL"
id222,"Address: Enmore Park, Kensington, W.'  There, take it with you.","ACD"
id4576,"Nothing more to do, Nibs?","ACR"
id5206,"The bed had not been disturbed, the candles had not been lit--to all appearance the room had not even been entered during the night.","WKL"
id650,"Now he halted in the       recess of the window.","ACD"
id1403,"The odds are enormously against your finding it.","ACD"
id5722,"Am I to understand, he asked, that the advice you wanted from me related to _this?_  Yes.","WKL"
id534,"It's not the first time, either, said the policeman, severely, shaking his head.","ACD"
id691,"Sherlock Holmes waved our strange visitor into a chair.","ACD"
id6742,"During an interval in the conversation, the attention of the ladies was suddenly attracted to this gate, by the sharp sound of the iron latch falling in its socket.","WKL"
id2498,"She laughed scornfully.","ACR"
id3380,"And yet there is no doubt that I, too, possess the deductive sense in a marked degree.","ACR"
id5494,"Don’t take a wife from the stage.","WKL"
id80,"She laughed at the elasticity of my character.","ACD"
id3680,"They’ve got one, now they’ll go for the other.","ACR"
id2475,"I never thought you a fool, my dear lady, but may I venture to suggest that you are somewhat foolhardy?","ACR"
id6951,"At the steps, she turned and looked round to see if Frank was following her.","WKL"
id2384,"Madame, this is a pleasure indeed.","ACR"
id1206,"But the _Times_ is a paper which is       seldom found in any hands but those of the highly educated.","ACD"

id2614,"I took them off to go into the cavern.","ACR"

id1468,"A debonair Hussar has room in his life for love, but none for a wife.","ACD"
id6144,"She stopped--her voice suddenly recovered its sweetness of tone--she smiled faintly--she said the old girlish words once more, in the old girlish way, Vow it, Blanche!","WKL"
id2121,"It was to be done in the early morning, and for two days running we have had a storming party of a thousand Grenadiers waiting for the breach to be formed.","ACD"
id3642,"We returned reluctantly, and Lord Yardly sent off one of the footmen post-haste to fetch the police.","ACR"
id4706,"cried Mrs. Cavendish.","ACR"
id879,"What was the use?","ACD"
id4428,"Farmer Raikes has got a very pretty young wife.","ACR"
id259,"He gathered his brows in scientific disapproval.","ACD"
id1916,"There were the rattle of arms and the cries of French soldiers in the hall.","ACD"
id2179,"Then he knelt down, levelled his musket, and fired.","ACD"
id1829,"Then he may have softened their hearts.","ACD"
id451,"Naturally, said I.","ACD"
id3071,"His tone seemed to indicate that such a thing was unlikely in the extreme.","ACR"
id5897,"I beg your pardon, he said.","WKL"
id3041,"Mrs. James did not see the lady, but thought that she had gone on ahead.","ACR"
id3427,"I also fancied that the dear old fellow was just the least inclined to be jealous.","ACR"
id2861,"I sat back on my heels and frowned at the opposite walls.","ACR"
id971,"There is no other claimant, I presume?","ACD"
id1321,"An instant afterwards he gave a little       cry of satisfaction, and, following the direction of his eager       eyes, I saw that a hansom cab with a man inside which had halted       on the other side of the street was now proceeding slowly onward       again.","ACD"
id6522,"At ten o’clock the next morning Norah and Magdalen stood alone in the hall at Combe-Raven watching the departure of the carriage which took their father and mother to the London train.","WKL"

id3800,"What _beau temps_, is it not?","ACR"
id312,"Nothing else I can do?","ACD"
id1429,"There are many soldiers who think that because one's trade is to make war one should never have a thought above fighting and plunder.","ACD"
id47,"I have never felt it.","ACD"
id401,"With these encouraging words the lady handed me over to the taciturn Austin, who had waited like a bronze statue of discretion during our short interview, and I was conducted to the end of the passage.","ACD"
id2335,"On the one hand there is no glory, for what glory could be gained by defeating this rabble of elderly shopkeepers, ignorant peasants, fanatical priests, excited women, and all the other creatures who made up the garrison?","ACD"
id5985,"Fetch my writing-desk out of the next room.","WKL"
id3076,"said the inspector.","ACR"
id6258,"Estimating him by years, he had turned fifty.","WKL"
id2057,"I was in the act of bowing to thank them for their acceptance when the door of the mess-room was flung open and the colonel hurried into the room, with an agitated face.","ACD"
id889,"What sort of night was it?’        Damp and raw.","ACD"
id4661,"I do hope she’s found him out at last!","ACR"
id4736,"We are afraid my mother is very ill. She seems to be having some kind of fit.","ACR"
id950,"I assure you that there is a reign of terror in the       district, and that it is a hardy man who will cross the moor at       night.","ACD"
id1645,"There was no hope for me in the old walls, in the tiny window, or in the massive door.","ACD"
id6839,"Good-night.","WKL"
id5867,"she asked, addressing her husband, after one steady look at Lady Jane.","WKL"
id1164,"He glanced swiftly over it, running his eyes       up and down the columns.","ACD"
id1114,"I think it unlikely that he waited at the moor-gate every       evening.","ACD"
id576,"Why so?","ACD"
id2904,"Sir Eustace Pedler, the owner of the Mill House, is wintering on the Riviera.","ACR"
id2362,"Her narrow black eyes narrowed themselves still more, the long line of her scarlet mouth curved faintly upwards.","ACR"
id3770,"_Bien!_ All is admitted.","ACR"
id1106,"If that were so, and it seems most probable, only a man       who had lost his wits would have run _from_ the house instead of       towards it.","ACD"
id6309,"Look at Norah (good-morning, my dear)—look, I say, at Norah.","WKL"
id6741,"The view from the windows looked over the flower-garden and shrubbery; this last being protected at its outward extremity by a fence, and approached from the lane beyond by a wicket-gate.","WKL"
id1700,"I saw the young man throw himself in an agony of grief into his chair.","ACD"
id1927,"I was about to point this out to him, but at the first word I uttered he gave a shout of astonishment, and, rushing out, he seized the lamp which hung in the corridor and flashed it in my face.","ACD"
id3745,"The Scotland Yard man grunted.","ACR"
id5969,"She inflicted reproof in the present without excluding hope in the future.","WKL"
id5421,"When she spoke to her husband it was evidently with a wish to soothe and conciliate him.","WKL"
id2026,"Some mocking answer was on his tongue, but my glance kept it there.","ACD"
id5652,"You were married at Inchmallock, in Ireland, Mr. Vanborough, thirteen years since?","WKL"
id3836,"The substitution will be discovered.","ACR"
id6478,"Half an hour passed, and neither Mr. Vanstone nor his wife left the breakfast-room.","WKL"

id4815,"Will she last out the night, I wonder?","WKL"
id5385,"They were both prettily dressed in white, with sashes of the same shade of light blue.","WKL"
id1369,"He turned into one of the district messenger offices, where he       was warmly greeted by the manager.","ACD"
id1100,"He was running, Watson—running desperately, running for his       life, running until he burst his heart—and fell dead upon his       face.","ACD"

id4968,"No, no--not the bottle!","WKL"
id1400,"Here are twenty-three       shillings.","ACD"
id2135,"Clearly.","ACD"
id6105,"In the latter part of her illness her mind gave way.","WKL"
id1934,"he asked.","ACD"
id174,"I'm afraid the day for this sort of thing is rather past.","ACD"
id5643,"And you have found out that I am right?","WKL"
id1777,"and Lucia!","ACD"
id6107,"The poor soul found the tone, almost the look, that had been lost for so many years--the tone of the past time when the two girls had gone their different ways in the world.","WKL"
id693,"I observe from your forefinger that you make       your own cigarettes.","ACD"
id5738,"Mr. Vanborough rose to his feet without replying, and took a turn in the room impatiently.","WKL"
id2918,"He explained to Mrs. James that he was a friend of the lady who had come to look over the house, but had stopped at the post office to send a telegram.","ACR"
id3296,"Why, it’s one of the show places of England.","ACR"
id217,"Winner of Crayston Medal for Zoological Research.","ACD"
id6956,"Come, Frank!","WKL"
id4954,"Which bottle?","WKL"
id6344,"In Miss Garth’s favorite phrase, Magdalen was born with all the senses—except a sense of order.","WKL"
id3707,"This morning, I understand.","ACR"
id1584,"But I am not taken so easily.","ACD"
id819,"This explanation was borne             out by the post-mortem examination, which showed             long-standing organic disease, and the coroner’s jury             returned a verdict in accordance with the medical evidence.","ACD"
id3860,"It seems a little unfair on Mary Marvell.","ACR"
id6311,"The vile gas, the foul air, the late hours—what can you expect?","WKL"
id4313,"Perhaps.","ACR"
id4604,"Poirot was an extraordinary looking little man.","ACR"
id826,"I must thank you, said Sherlock Holmes, for calling my       attention to a case which certainly presents some features of       interest.","ACD"
id5248,"I'm ill--I'm faint--I want air, she answered, speaking thickly and confusedly.","WKL"
id3573,"Then he glanced at my friend.","ACR"
id945,"Since the tragedy, Mr. Holmes, there have come to my ears       several incidents which are hard to reconcile with the settled       order of Nature.","ACD"
id3943,"A mass of nerves, poor thing.","ACR"
id300,"My scientific education having been somewhat neglected, I was unable to follow the whole argument, but it was evident that the English Professor had handled his subject in a very aggressive fashion, and had thoroughly annoyed his Continental colleagues.","ACD"
id1994,"You will sympathise with me.","ACD"
id3796,"Believe me, it was necessary for the diamond to be stolen.","ACR"
id2283,"The powder is stored in the Mother Superior's room.","ACD"
id3374,"She thanked me and sat down.","ACR"
id3764,"Lord Yardly.","ACR"
id6550,"But Miss Garth had lived too long and too intimately under Mr. Vanstone’s roof to be parted with for any purely formal considerations; and the first hint at going away which she had thought it her duty to drop was dismissed with such affectionate warmth of protest that she never repeated it again, except in jest.","WKL"
id2208,"The smell within the city was so horrible that one wondered how people could live in it, for during the months that the siege had lasted there had been no attempt to cleanse the streets or to bury the dead.","ACD"
id3886,"You’ve gone a bit too far this time.","ACR"
id758,"The moon shone clear above them, and they rode             swiftly abreast, taking that course which the maid must             needs have taken if she were to reach her own home.","ACD"
id4585,"But they were both gay enough this afternoon, and chatted together like a couple of children.","ACR"
id4354,"Cynthia Murdoch was a fresh-looking young creature, full of life and vigour.","ACR"
id1952,"This was the way, my friends, in which I lost my ear.","ACD"
id3715,"The whole point of it was to get us to concentrate on the Friday, and so be off our guard beforehand.","ACR"
id2876,"I was the only person who had seen anything of the affair.","ACR"
id236,"In my opinion he's just a homicidal megalomaniac with a turn for science.","ACD"
id3973,"And what do you think of Dr. Bernard, Hastings?","ACR"
id6046,"It was not desirable (on his own sole responsibility) to let the servants see what had happened.","WKL"
id2982,"I wavered between injured dignity and the overwhelming desire to express my theories.","ACR"
id6016,"In two words, madam, answered Mr. Delamayn; waste paper.","WKL"
id2078,"If you will come with me I will give you your instructions.","ACD"
id179,"Talking of the blank spaces of the map gives me an idea.","ACD"
id3323,"She stopped.","ACR"
id937,"Oh, Dr.       Mortimer, Dr. Mortimer, to think that you should not have called       me in!","ACD"

id1326,"Instantly the trapdoor at the top flew up, something was screamed       to the driver, and the cab flew madly off down Regent Street.","ACD"
id6340,"She bloomed in the full physical maturity of twenty years or more—bloomed naturally and irresistibly, in right of her matchless health and strength.","WKL"
id4630,"Perhaps you’re right, Dorcas—yes—no—not now.","ACR"
id5432,"He referred to the letting of the house.","WKL"
id3487,"Can’t make head or tail of it.","ACR"
id6380,"It was altogether above my mark.","WKL"
id1668,"A minute later there was a heavy splash, and I knew that no human eye would ever see Auret again.","ACD"
id2217,"I raised my hand as I spoke and pointed forward.","ACD"
id5116,"Mistress, dear mistress, you drank it all--there is nothing but the opiate left.","WKL"

id3152,"Unknown to her, she is being shadowed by three men and a middle-aged woman.","ACR"
id2140,"I shrank away from it.","ACD"
id1828,"I heard him.","ACD"
id2605,"Stern silent men, I murmured to myself in an ecstasy.","ACR"
id4469,"The Inglethorps did not appear.","ACR"
id115,"That was brave of you.","ACD"
id4269,"I’ll write to Lady Tadminster for the second day, myself.","ACR"
id4500,"He’s gone through every penny he ever had, publishing rotten verses in fancy bindings.","ACR"
id3267,"A slight cloud passed over the actress’s face, and she replied constrainedly:  I’m afraid that’s impossible.","ACR"
id1915,"Another shout and then the crash of a hatchet and the splintering of planks.","ACD"
id1710,"You are thieves and murderers, every man of you, he cried.","ACD"
id3752,"Only one thing had been taken—‘the Western Star.’  We stared at each other—the whole thing was so bizarre, so unreal.","ACR"
id1912,"The Emperor!","ACD"
id6005,"I beg to refer you to my man of business.","WKL"
id3180,"Always with you it is the non-essentials!","ACR"
id147,"Was it hardness, was it selfishness, that she should ask me to risk my life for her own glorification?","ACD"
id6061,"A stranger--older, years older, than Lady Jane.","WKL"
id1940,"This noble gentleman--he has taken my place, Lorenzo!","ACD"
id5582,"Does she know about it?","WKL"
id2990,"You didn’t see any one?","ACR"
id146,"Behold me, then, at the office of the Daily Gazette, on the staff of which I was a most insignificant unit, with the settled determination that very night, if possible, to find the quest which should be worthy of my Gladys!","ACD"
id6088,"She had met the merciless injury inflicted on her with a rare patience, with an admirable courage.","WKL"
id5567,"Reconsider your conduct; reconsider what you have said to me--or you count me no longer among your friends.","WKL"
id4200,"But the mater cottoned to him at once, took him on as secretary—you know how she’s always running a hundred societies?","ACR"
id5002,"The pen went on; and more slowly, more feebly, formed words enough to fill a line--then stopped.","WKL"
id6875,"These two went away first, to receive the visitors.","WKL"
id5899,"I am _not_ that lady’s husband.","WKL"
id5614,"His hard, hairless face, his watchful gray eyes, his thin, resolute lips, said plainly, in so many words, I mean to get on in the world; and, if you are in my way, I mean to get on at your expense.","WKL"
id2977,"Perhaps the young lady would tell us briefly what her ideas really are on the subject, inspector?","ACR"
id3398,"That is so, she acknowledged.","ACR"
id6320,"She nodded and waved her hand in return, very gracefully and prettily—but with something of old-fashioned formality in her manner, which looked strangely in so young a woman, and which seemed out of harmony with a salutation addressed to her father.","WKL"
id1625,"Bury your knives in his body.","ACD"
id1535,"Yes, but it is not for you or me to take it out of their hands.","ACD"
id5645,"I wish to be sure that no mistake has occurred between you and the clerk.","WKL"
id974,"The second brother, who died young, is       the father of this lad Henry.","ACD"
id5287,"Shadowed by its position, this ruinous side of the house had a dark, cold, wintry aspect, even on the sunny August morning when Sarah Leeson strayed into the deserted northern garden.","WKL"
id2275,"They have killed me for it.","ACD"
id5692,"What do you mean?","WKL"
id5879,"Mr. Vanborough obeyed, without looking at his wife, and without mentioning his wife’s name.","WKL"
id5112,"Mrs. Treverton began for the third time.","WKL"
id5137,"Stop, though, he continued, after a moment's reflection.","WKL"
id5943,"If you can tell the truth, Sir, she said, haughtily, be so good as to tell it now.","WKL"
id862,"Sir Charles lay on his face, his arms out, his       fingers dug into the ground, and his features convulsed with some       strong emotion to such an extent that I could hardly have sworn       to his identity.","ACD"
id4693,"It was a glorious night, hot and still.","ACR"
id538,"I relented.","ACD"
id3257,"I pray of you, Hastings, hand me my little almanac.","ACR"
id4997,"Sarah peered anxiously over her shoulder, and saw the pen slowly and feebly form these three words: _To my Husband_.","WKL"
id1003,"How long will it take you to make up your mind?","ACD"
id5039,"Her eyes recovered their steady look of intelligence; and, when she again addressed her maid, reiterating the word Write, she was able to enforce the direction by beginning immediately to dictate in quiet, deliberate, determined tones.","WKL"
id3212,"Mary Marvell was undoubtedly one of the most popular actresses on the screen.","ACR"
id4522,"The famous bazaar had taken place on Saturday, and an entertainment, in connection with the same charity, at which Mrs. Inglethorp was to recite a War poem, was to be held that night.","ACR"
id6195,"He had a temper of his own, if the truth must be told; and with nothing against him--on the contrary, with every thing in his favor--he didn’t make friends.","WKL"
id6524,"No such explanation had been offered.","WKL"
id2023,"I trust, Captain Gerard, that you do not mean to alter our hours, said he, and again there was a burst of laughter, which died away as I looked slowly round the circle.","ACD"
id4438,"So I’m off.","ACR"
id4453,"Oh, I know what I’m talking about.","ACR"
id3478,"Everything points that way.","ACR"
id6274,"The self-possession of her progress downstairs, and the air of habitual authority with which she looked about her, spoke well for her position in Mr. Vanstone’s family.","WKL"
id2443,"It must be for profit, eh?","ACR"
id4610,"Yet this quaint dandified little man who, I was sorry to see, now limped badly, had been in his time one of the most celebrated members of the Belgian police.","ACR"
id3808,"From Mr. Rolf.","ACR"
id678,"It was necessary to make a home       of my own.","ACD"
id1598,"My pursuers had crowded in behind me and choked the doorway, so that all further flight was out of the question.","ACD"
id4850,"cried Robert.","WKL"
id1856,"We may yet be saved, I whispered.","ACD"
id1657,"Help!","ACD"
id1588,"The room into which I had broken was brilliantly lighted.","ACD"
id21,"However, come what might, I should have done with suspense and bring matters to a head to-night.","ACD"
id327,"There is one sentence in it, however--namely:  'I protest strongly against the insufferable and entirely dogmatic assertion that each separate id is a microcosm possessed of an historical architecture elaborated slowly through the series of generations.'","ACD"
id3780,"I sent that wire, and hired the gentleman in question.","ACR"
id5065,"He said, 'Are you at peace with all the world?'","WKL"
id6990,"Necessity, which knows no law, either in the drama or out of it, accepted a lad of eighteen as the representative of Sir Anthony Absolute; the stage-manager undertaking to supply the necessary wrinkles from the illimitable resources of theatrical art.","WKL"
id6188,"He put a few questions to a well-informed person.","WKL"
id331,"With your consent, I trust to have the honor of calling at eleven o'clock the day after to-morrow (Wednesday) morning.","ACD"
id3730,"A very few minutes sufficed to give us the facts.","ACR"
id1781,"How came you into their hands?","ACD"
id4587,"As I came out again, I cannoned into a little man who was just entering.","ACR"
id5636,"Mr. Delamayn looked at him for a moment, and went on.","WKL"
id1968,"It chanced that the war had come to a halt in Germany, while it was still raging in Spain, so the Emperor, wishing to reinforce the Spanish army, transferred me as senior captain to the Hussars of Conflans, which were at that time in the Fifth Army Corps under Marshal Lannes.","ACD"
id3741,"The man looked up at him and started.","ACR"
id4292,"With the presence of Mr. Inglethorp, a sense of constraint and veiled hostility seemed to settle down upon the company.","ACR"
id4284,"It was one of the longest and blackest I have ever seen.","ACR"
id210,"I give it you briefly:--  'Challenger, George Edward.","ACD"
id1324,"We’ll have a good look at       him, if we can do no more.","ACD"
id5559,"Nothing.","WKL"
id5880,"Lady Jane Parnell, he said, passing over the introduction as rapidly as possible.","WKL"
id52,"But why can't you love me, Gladys?","ACD"
id2741,"And a few minutes later another phrase floated up to me, in an even more acid voice:  I agree with you!","ACR"
id2024,"What hour is the assembly?","ACD"
id5317,"Any hardship      or misfortune which may follow as a consequence of this      deceitful proceeding on my part, will fall on myself.","WKL"
id452,"And that telegony is still sub judice?","ACD"
id2458,"You see, the plan was to substitute some of the De Beer diamonds for some sample diamonds brought from South America by two young prospectors who happened to be in Kimberley at the time.","ACR"
id5745,"Mr. Vanborough sat down again at the table, to consider the alternative of asserting or not asserting his freedom from the marriage tie.","WKL"
id5403,"A journey ordered by the doctors in India a year since, rejoined Mrs. Vanborough.","WKL"
id5566,"I never sought this explanation--but now it has come, I won’t shrink from it.","WKL"
id6570,"His hair was iron-gray, carefully brushed round at the temples.","WKL"
id3011,"He was tall and broad-shouldered, wore a dark overcoat and black boots, a bowler hat.","ACR"
id6574,"His frock-coat was buttoned tight round the waist, and left to bulge open majestically at the chest.","WKL"
id2992,"I didn’t turn my head.","ACR"
id2544,"We are not descended from monkeys, but are monkeys descended from _us?_ Eminent Professor says chimpanzees are decadent humans.","ACR"
id127,"It is women like you who brace men up.","ACD"
id3965,"You will not find any bullet wounds on the body of Mr. Maltravers, said Dr. Bernard dryly.","ACR"
id6661,"Always the earliest riser among the ladies of the house, Miss Garth was alone in the breakfast-room when the letter was brought in.","WKL"
id2548,"In fact, for a moment I meditated running after the young man and informing him that my father had changed his mind and would send the articles in question.","ACR"
id1280,"And also, said Holmes, that someone is not ill-disposed       towards you, since they warn you of danger.","ACD"
id5341,"Anne was rarely beautiful and rarely endowed.","WKL"
id1258,"Then I understand that on your arrival in London yesterday you       went out at once and bought a pair of boots?","ACD"
id1936,"I shook off my weakness, and pressing my handkerchief to my wound I rose from my couch, the debonair colonel of Hussars.","ACD"
id2998,"How do you know that, Miss Beddingfeld?","ACR"
id2997,"He wasn’t a doctor, I repeated.","ACR"
id1558,"There were four of them, then, but the little steward might be left out of the reckoning.","ACD"
id600,"The man is certainly a country practitioner.","ACD"
id1753,"Matteo, you will lead this prisoner to the wooden cell.","ACD"
id6975,"Having further accustomed themselves to the breaking of furniture and the staining of walls—to thumping, tumbling, hammering, and screaming; to doors always banging, and to footsteps perpetually running up and down stairs—the nominal master and mistress of the house fondly believed that their chief troubles were over.","WKL"
id4213,"Mainly owing to the mater’s activities.","ACR"
id3420,"Captain Hastings.","ACR"
id6129,"Blanche!","WKL"
id4465,"With her hand on the handle, she turned her head over her shoulder, and beckoned to me.","ACR"
id1191,"There is as much difference to my eyes between the       leaded bourgeois type of a _Times_ article and the slovenly print       of an evening half-penny paper as there could be between your       negro and your Esquimau.","ACD"
id5822,"She turned to Mr. Delamayn.","WKL"
id1224,"Halloa!","ACD"
id2716,"We will look round for something—suitable.","ACR"
id4230,"No, Cynthia is a protegee of my mother’s, the daughter of an old schoolfellow of hers, who married a rascally solicitor.","ACR"
id3523,"Still, it’s not the easiest thing in the world to find a purchaser.","ACR"
id580,"said Holmes.","ACD"
id2919,"She directed him to the house, and thought no more about the matter.","ACR"
id4319,"I came across a man in Belgium once, a very famous detective, and he quite inflamed me.","ACR"
id1057,"Exactly.","ACD"
id5263,"Her eyes wandered from the building itself to the cemetery by its side, rested there, and watched the light growing warmer and warmer over the lonesome refuge where the dead lay at rest.","WKL"
id1334,"I have not an idea.","ACD"
id5324,"She knelt down, putting the letter on the boards beside her, opposite the key-hole of the fourth door she came to after reaching the top of the stairs, peered in distrustfully for an instant, then began to try the different keys till she found one that fitted the lock.","WKL"
id1567,"Get up, I say, and for the second time he spurned me with his foot.","ACD"
id2304,"One of them held the lantern which he carried up in front of the dying man, and both of them burst into a shout of mocking laughter.","ACD"
id5881,"Let me see you to your carriage, he added, offering his arm.","WKL"
id998,"He comes in fifty       minutes.","ACD"
id2186,"The Spaniard stood peering down through the darkness, while an occasional groan from below showed that the sergeant was still living.","ACD"
id986,"And yet       it cannot be denied that the prosperity of the whole poor, bleak       countryside depends upon his presence.","ACD"
id6544,"Be as brisk and cheerful both of you as I am.","WKL"
id5955,"Is that lady your wife?","WKL"
id4385,"John will show you your room.","ACR"
id364,"I found afterwards that he was the chauffeur, who filled the gaps left by a succession of fugitive butlers.","ACD"
id6140,"She must be a governess--she must get her bread.","WKL"
id5024,"Write, or I shall not rest in my grave.","WKL"
id981,"Now, Mr. Holmes, what would you advise       me to do with him?","ACD"
id3716,"It is a pity you did not realize that.","ACR"
id3344,"But there!","ACR"
id4427,"Well, don’t let him have too much of it.","ACR"
id4223,"She is up at five every morning to milk, and keeps at it steadily until lunchtime.","ACR"
id6789,"But he _shall_ take it, persisted Mr. Vanstone.","WKL"
id3535,"You will that I preserve for you your diamond, _n’est-ce pas_?","ACR"
id3276,"He took the jewel in his own hand and scrutinized it keenly, then restored it to her with a little bow.","ACR"
id1507,"An instant later I heard once more the swishing of the water and the creaking of the oar.","ACD"
id3632,"I pulled it open as I spoke.","ACR"
id2463,"I kept back some of the South American stones—one or two are unique and could easily be proved never to have passed through De Beer’s hands.","ACR"
id4506,"Her presence had spelt security.","ACR"
id1506,"I could not shout, I could not move; I was a mere bundle.","ACD"
id3345,"She’s a woman through and through, and I guess she can’t bear to think of another woman outshining her in the jewel line.","ACR"
id4015,"She led the way out of the room and found and handed the little weapon to Poirot, who examined it cursorily.","ACR"
id5647,"I am going to take the responsibility of giving an opinion which may be followed by serious consequences; and I mean to assure myself that the opinion is given on a sound basis, first.","WKL"
id4525,"I noticed that John’s manner was somewhat unusual.","ACR"
id2354,"I fancy it was for my blessing that they asked, and my Ora pro nobis seemed to entirely satisfy them.","ACD"
id4934,"Not the doctor--not even your master, said Mrs. Treverton, and pointed to the door.","WKL"
id4999,"no!","WKL"
id2728,"With the inspiration of genius, I had kicked it once, punched it twice, dented in the crown and affixed to it a thing like a cubist’s dream of a jazz carrot.","ACR"
id759,"They had gone a mile or two when they passed one of the             night shepherds upon the moorlands, and they cried to him             to know if he had seen the hunt.","ACD"
id5378,"The husband’s name was Vanborough.","WKL"
id2822,"I remained where I was, rooted to the spot by a sort of horrible fascination.","ACR"
id6069,"Is it thus we meet again?","WKL"
id2447,"You were wrong.","ACR"
id1764,"The boards must have made a creaking.","ACD"
id255,"It was the man of all others whom I should have chosen--Tarp Henry, of the staff of Nature, a thin, dry, leathery creature, who was full, to those who knew him, of kindly humanity.","ACD"
id1820,"I swore it to her between my clenched teeth.","ACD"
id4026,"She shook her head.","ACR"
id5583,"No.","WKL"
id1467,"Some of our French officers married in Venice that winter, and I might have done the same, for I loved her with all my heart; but Etienne Gerard has his sword, his horse, his regiment, his mother, his Emperor, and his career.","ACD"
id5292,"she thought to herself, smoothing out the crumpled paper dreamily in the palm of her hand.","WKL"
id4546,"Every single person who comes up here says that.","ACR"
id2049,"I will thus be able to devote five minutes to each before the assembly is blown.","ACD"
id1397,"You could easily recognize it,       could you not?","ACD"
id929,"But       the marks?","ACD"
id3957,"He was lying at the edge of a small plantation.","ACR"
id6111,"When they had gone she looked at Lady Lundie, and woke, as it seemed, to consciousness from a dream.","WKL"
id6646,"Post-office, Bristol._    CHAPTER III.","WKL"
id6746,"As he came nearer, however, she started in astonishment; and, turning quickly to her mother and sister, proclaimed the gentleman in the garden to be no other than Mr. Francis Clare.","WKL"
id5331,"I.","WKL"
id2624,"Dazed as I was, I appreciated that.","ACR"
id1013,"I have not heard of any.","ACD"
id6041,"in the face of the facts!)","WKL"
id4006,"I comprehend.","ACR"
id973,"The only other kinsman whom we have been able to trace was       Rodger Baskerville, the youngest of three brothers of whom poor       Sir Charles was the elder.","ACD"
id5274,"Is it all my fault?","WKL"
id701,"Recognizing, as I do, that you are the second highest       expert in Europe—        Indeed, sir!","ACD"
id6729,"Had the household revolution run its course already?","WKL"
id770,"But it was not the sight of her body, nor yet was             it that of the body of Hugo Baskerville lying near her,             which raised the hair upon the heads of these three             dare-devil roysterers, but it was that, standing over Hugo,             and plucking at his throat, there stood a foul thing, a             great, black beast, shaped like a hound, yet larger than             any hound that ever mortal eye has rested upon.","ACD"
id4670,"I tried to forget the few words I had overheard; but, do what I would, I could not dismiss them altogether from my mind.","ACR"
id1667,"I yelled, and I kicked at my door, but again I heard him shout and then everything was silent.","ACD"
id1007,"He scribbled the appointment on his       shirt-cuff and hurried off in his strange, peering, absent-minded       fashion.","ACD"
id3329,"You do not fear to introduce these two Siamese twins to each other lest a Chinaman should appear and, hey presto!","ACR"
id141,"You should have been at the office for evening duty half an hour ago; only I hadn't the heart to remind you.","ACD"
id1344,"When our friends left I       at once followed them in the hopes of marking down their       invisible attendant.","ACD"
id734,"Most modern.","ACD"
id3963,"I demand pardon, said Poirot humbly.","ACR"
id404,"As I entered, his seat spun round to face me.","ACD"
id3074,"The man who had an order to view this same house at Marlow in his pocket.","ACR"
id5303,"As binding as an oath?","WKL"
id3109,"But some one might have been walking up the platform towards us—some one he recognized.","ACR"
id1895,"How is it with you now?","ACD"
id5094,"I won't trust you on your promise.","WKL"
id1703,"You are Colonel Gerard?","ACD"
id2497,"He is a man whom it is particularly easy to—underestimate.","ACR"
id6685,"Such were the terms in which Mrs. Vanstone concluded that first part of her letter which referred exclusively to Captain Wragge.","WKL"
id5435,"Leaving the house is not the worst of the sacrifice, answered Mrs. Vanborough.","WKL"
id4749,"Try going through Mr. Inglethorp’s room, sir, cried Dorcas.","ACR"
id2097,"I will confess to you, my friends, that a cold chill passed up my back and my hair rose upon my head.","ACD"
id6390,"Have you forgotten the yellow-looking foreign woman, with the unpronounceable name?","WKL"
id4016,"Two shots fired, I see, he observed, as he handed it back.","ACR"
id2950,"I understand you’ve something to tell me that you think may be of use to us.","ACR"
id762,"But soon their skins turned cold, for there came a             galloping across the moor, and the black mare, dabbled with             white froth, went past with trailing bridle and empty             saddle.","ACD"
id3699,"What do you think, _mon ami_?","ACR"
id1069,"This small clump of buildings       here is the hamlet of Grimpen, where our friend Dr. Mortimer has       his headquarters.","ACD"
id832,"In doing so, said Dr. Mortimer, who had begun to show signs of       some strong emotion, I am telling that which I have not confided       to anyone.","ACD"
id5210,"I must!","WKL"
id2988,"It wasn’t me.","ACR"
id1092,"It has certainly a character of its own.","ACD"
id5499,"I want a great deal more.","WKL"
id3456,".","ACR"
id5517,"She is forty-two, and I am thirty-five; and I have been married to her for thirteen years.","WKL"
id4674,"Mrs. Inglethorp came down last.","ACR"
id4758,"We must try and break the door in, I suppose.","ACR"
id1367,"A clever man upon so delicate an errand has no       use for a beard save to conceal his features.","ACD"
id2980,"You’ve asked questions and hinted things.","ACR"
id3491,"First, _milord_, I would ask you if these facts are substantially correct?","ACR"
id2745,"With a deep sigh I proceeded to do things to my hair.","ACR"
id6963,"Why not take it?","WKL"
id2209,"Many people were moving up and down from fire to fire, and among them I observed several monks.","ACD"
id5797,"Pray accept my excuses for this intrusion.","WKL"
id609,"And if we take this as a       working hypothesis we have a fresh basis from which to start our       construction of this unknown visitor.","ACD"
id5259,"The daylight out of doors was clear already.","WKL"
id472,"You think you are omnipotent, you infernal scribblers, don't you?","ACD"
id2294,"The man was indeed in a hopeless plight, and the kindest action would have been that for which he begged.","ACD"
id5356,"Come out to India if you do.","WKL"
id5184,"Saying those last words, she desperately held the letter within an inch of the flame of the candle.","WKL"
id6809,"give you time, and you’ll defend yourself.","WKL"
id1921,"Then he broke out again.","ACD"
id1393,"Yes, sir.","ACD"
id3094,"Young ladies are romantic, I know—fond of mysteries and such-like.","ACR"
id4666,"I do wish I knew what it was all about.","ACR"
id856,"I thought that       a few months among the distractions of town would send him back a       new man.","ACD"
id2643,"The position seemed even more unromantic than before, and yet something in me urged towards its acceptance.","ACR"
id877,"As clearly as I see you.","ACD"
id3385,"She stared at me open-mouthed, all colour banished from her cheeks.","ACR"
id1425,"But the great days are gone and the great men are dead, and here am I, the last of them, drinking wine of Suresnes and telling old tales in a cafe.","ACD"
id1970,"My new regiment formed part of the force which, under Marshal Lannes, was then besieging the Spanish town of Saragossa.","ACD"

id3705,"Poirot hung his head.","ACR"
id5903,"Mr. Delamayn had set himself right--Mr. Delamayn declined to interfere further.","WKL"
id5492,"Mr. Vanborough opened the conversation.","WKL"
id3737,"I looked at him, said the clerk who was telling us this, and I saw at once what he meant.","ACR"
id4971,"Wait, pray wait till I get a glass.","WKL"
id6,"At last I was alone with Gladys, and the moment of Fate had come!","ACD"
id3870,"She came by the advice of Mary Cavendish to seek my aid in her dilemma.","ACR"
id6853,"In some other pursuit, for which he was more fit, and in which he could feel an interest, he would no doubt display the industry and perseverance which he had been too much discouraged to practice in the profession that he had now abandoned.","WKL"
id6734,"Fire itself leaves the confession, in ashes, of the substance consumed in it.","WKL"
id1529,"From the voices and the steps there seemed now to be several people round me.","ACD"
id3831,"She had no money of her own, and she was forced to permit him to substitute a paste replica for the real stone.","ACR"
id1617,"The same terrible silence fell upon the assembly, and the same twelve pairs of merciless eyes were bent upon my face.","ACD"
id5186,"Her eye caught sight of it, as it waved gently backward and forward.","WKL"
id3016,"But from this moment I gave the inspector up as hopeless.","ACR"
id5964,"He was only a profligate single man.","WKL"
id2526,"Papa did not care for modern man—even Neolithic Man he despised as a mere herder of cattle, and he did not rise to enthusiasm until he reached the Mousterian period.","ACR"
id4714,"At this juncture, Mrs. Inglethorp called to Cynthia from the hall, and the girl ran out.","ACR"
id6758,"He took his exercise and his fresh air under protest; and always walked the same distance to a yard, on the ugliest high-road in the neighborhood.","WKL"
id1340,"Yes, I remember.","ACD"
id847,"He chanced to be at his hall       door.","ACD"
id6124,"Yes.","WKL"
id3620,"Then I uttered another cry which Lord Yardly echoed.","ACR"
id1031,"Several rolls of paper lay around him.","ACD"
id3511,"Might as well get the thing straight.","ACR"
id3302,"She looked suddenly a good deal older.","ACR"
id2232,"Perhaps he did not live alone.","ACD"
id5548,"Friends who remember her as the famous opera-singer.","WKL"
id975,"The third, Rodger, was the black       sheep of the family.","ACD"
id5631,"With that reply Mr. Delamayn took a written paper from his pocket, and spread it out on the table before him.","WKL"
id1483,"The fellow took his place behind me and began to row.","ACD"
id5156,"The instant Sarah Leeson had turned the key of her bedroom door, she took the sheet of note-paper from its place of concealment in her bosom--shuddering, when she drew it out, as if the mere contact of it hurt her--placed it open on her little dressing-table, and fixed her eyes eagerly on the lines which the note contained.","WKL"
id2391,"You had a great success to-night, he remarked.","ACR"
id5252,"Now our mistress is dead, she will have to find another place, I suppose.","WKL"
id4602,"Then, as I looked at him inquiringly: Yes, my friend, she had kindly extended hospitality to seven of my countrypeople who, alas, are refugees from their native land.","ACR"
id592,"There are certainly one or two       indications upon the stick.","ACD"
id410,"He had the face and beard which I associate with an Assyrian bull; the former florid, the latter so black as almost to have a suspicion of blue, spade-shaped and rippling down over his chest.","ACD"
id1708,"I am an honourable soldier, said I. I have obeyed my orders and done my duty.","ACD"
id434,"You had, as I have been led to believe, some comments to make upon the proposition which I advanced in my thesis.","ACD"
id235,"Got so touchy that he assaults anyone who asks questions, and heaves reporters down the stairs.","ACD"
id6547,"Concluding her address of expostulation in those terms, Miss Garth led Norah to the library door, pushed Magdalen into the morning-room, and went on her own way sternly to the regions of the medicine-chest.","WKL"
id3144,"It was clear that he did not know how to spell brachycephalic.","ACR"
id6639,"His brown eye twinkled, his green eye twinkled, his curly lips smiled sweetly.","WKL"
id5775,"Mind, if she comes here, she’s only to look into the room, and go out again.","WKL"
id3126,"H’m, said the inspector.","ACR"
id6629,"His curling lips took a new twist upward; he tucked his umbrella briskly under his arm; and produced from the breast of his coat a large old-fashioned black pocketbook.","WKL"
id4642,"It may have been my fancy, but she, too, was looking odd and disturbed.","ACR"
id354,"I should have thought that only a sub-human intelligence could have failed to grasp the point, but if it really needs amplification I shall consent to see you at the hour named, though visits and visitors of every sort are exceeding distasteful to me.","ACD"
id2676,"My poor child, he said.","ACR"
id5882,"I will take care that you have the refusal of the house.","WKL"
id6412,"The door opened, and Magdalen returned with the key.","WKL"
id2602,"Write to my publishers.","ACR"
id5295,"May I not risk the worst that can happen, so long as I hold religiously to all that I undertook to do on my oath?","WKL"
id6983,"Nine more speaking characters were left to be fitted with representatives; and with that unavoidable necessity the serious troubles began.","WKL"
id1407,"2704, and then we will drop into one of the Bond Street       picture galleries and fill in the time until we are due at the       hotel.","ACD"
id1897,"I made no answer.","ACD"
id6220,"They saw their way to supplying the place of their Attorney-General, and they offered the judicial appointment to Mr. Delamayn.","WKL"
id436,"I must still make play and wait for a better opening.","ACD"
id5918,"she said.","WKL"
id5677,"Did he ask any thing more?","WKL"
id2005,"I told them more.","ACD"
id2433,"Nadina shook her head.","ACR"
id2201,"several times, and, crouching in the shadow, I saw in the moonlight a bearded head, which protruded from a trap-door.","ACD"
id4667,"I thought of Mrs. Raikes’s gipsy face, and Evelyn Howard’s warnings, but wisely decided to hold my peace, whilst Cynthia exhausted every possible hypothesis, and cheerfully hoped, Aunt Emily will send him away, and will never speak to him again.","ACR"
id3899,"The Northern Union Insurance Company have asked me to investigate the death of a Mr. Maltravers who a few weeks ago insured his life with them for the large sum of fifty thousand pounds.","ACR"
id340,"If he is a sportsman he will be tickled.","ACD"
id2891,"I smiled to myself.","ACR"
id2455,"A hundred thousand pounds worth of stones.","ACR"
id4308,"she asked.","ACR"
id4796,"I saw that a faint streak of daylight was showing through the curtains of the windows, and that the clock on the mantelpiece pointed to close upon five o’clock.","ACR"
id1157,"It seems to me that       all you gentlemen know a great deal more than I do about my own       affairs.","ACD"
id2298,"It was my own safeguard against torture, and yet this poor soul was in very pressing need of it, and he had deserved well of France.","ACD"
id1805,"Her words froze my blood with horror.","ACD"
id1027,"It was nearly nine o’clock when I found       myself in the sitting-room once more.","ACD"
id415,"Well?","ACD"
id6276,"Here was a woman who lived on ascertained and honorable terms with her employers—a woman who looked capable of sending any parents in England to the right-about, if they failed to rate her at her proper value.","WKL"
id1144,"Hum!","ACD"
id1482,"But the gondoliers of Venice are a strong breed, and powerful men are common enough among them.","ACD"
id5972,"Good-evening!","WKL"
id1249,"Exactly, said Holmes, however foolish the incident may seem.","ACD"
id6283,"Bring the kettle at a quarter to ten—and if you don’t get better in the course of the day, come to me, and I’ll give you a dose of physic.","WKL"
id2386,"Alone with her visitor, a subtle change came over Nadina’s smile.","ACR"
id4930,"No one?","WKL"
id3247,"Because it was from a Chink in San Francisco that Gregory bought the stone three years ago.","ACR"
id990,"Put into plain words, the matter is this, said he.","ACD"
id6166,"To what conclusion did all this point?","WKL"
id3884,"I had not the heart to shatter your illusions.","ACR"
id5779,"Where’s your mistress?","WKL"
id2826,"A tall man with a brown beard pressed past me and bent over the motionless body.","ACR"
id4296,"Occasionally she referred to her husband over a question of days or dates.","ACR"
id1418,"Besides, he deserved a lesson, for if one does not like a prima donna's singing one can always be silent, but it is intolerable that a public affront should be put upon a pretty woman.","ACD"
id5257,"The cool, sweet air in the garden, blowing freshly over Sarah's face, seemed to calm the violence of her agitation.","WKL"
id5973,"She accompanied the last words by a farewell look which aroused Mrs. Vanborough to frenzy.","WKL"
id1744,"But he is a true Venetian, and when the first agony is over he will understand that it could not be otherwise.","ACD"
id2899,"A sensational discovery was made yesterday at the Mill House, Marlow.","ACR"
id5717,"said Mr. Kendrew.","WKL"
id5253,"I, for one, sha'n't break my heart when she's gone.","WKL"
id4141,"You see it all, do you not?","ACR"
id395,"Remember he believes it himself.","ACD"
id3696,"About two o’clock, the telephone rang.","ACR"
id1792,"Oh, Etienne, Etienne, they will kill you.","ACD"
id2572,"There are undoubtedly certain resemblances to the Java skull, but superficial—superficial only.","ACR"
id3689,"My idea was to go at once to the _Magnificent_, and relate to Miss Marvell what had occurred, but Poirot vetoed the plan, and insisted that the morning would be time enough.","ACR"
id5207,"There was but one other place to seek him--the chamber in which his wife lay dead.","WKL"
id4957,"The other.","WKL"
id1232,"Why, no, Mr. Holmes.","ACD"
id4338,"I’d feel it in my fingertips if he came near me.","ACR"
id5423,"I shall be better when those children have done clattering with their knives and forks.","WKL"
id3598,"Wait while I turn the big light on and you shall feast your eyes on the ugliest necklace in England.","ACR"
id2302,"Next moment the door was flung open and two Spaniards strode into the room, fierce, swarthy men in the dress of citizens, but with muskets slung over their shoulders.","ACD"
id6912,"He’s in the business, too.","WKL"
id13,"It is no compliment to a man.","ACD"
id933,"If I had only been there!","ACD"
id6909,"You needn’t throw away your cigar, Frank.","WKL"
id2536,"We never seemed to have any money.","ACR"
id5737,"I’ll have a glass of wine.","WKL"
id3388,"How?","ACR"
id840,"He had brought back much scientific information from South       Africa, and many a charming evening we have spent together       discussing the comparative anatomy of the Bushman and the       Hottentot.","ACD"
id4716,"I’m going to bed.","ACR"
id5246,"Passing the candle she had left there, without so much as a look at it, she made for the stairs, and descended them with headlong rapidity to the kitchen-floor.","WKL"
id2435,"Listen, my friend, to-morrow I go to London.","ACR"
id5276,"Her mind was apparently steadied by the reflection which her last words expressed.","WKL"
id4496,"Hard up, are you?","ACR"
id3289,"A few years ago Lord and Lady Yardly had paid a visit to the States, rumour had it that his lordship had rather gone the pace out there with the assistance of some lady friends—but surely there was something more, some gossip which coupled Lady Yardly’s name with that of a movie star in California—why!","ACR"
id4885,"The trouble and fear in her voice, as she spoke, seemed to add to its sweetness; the agitation of her manner took nothing away from its habitual gentleness, its delicate, winning, feminine restraint.","WKL"
id5143,"A strange woman!","WKL"
id3443,".","ACR"
id1807,"Lucia!","ACD"
id6545,"Come, rouse up directly.","WKL"
id1085,"I think we’ll shut       that window again, if you don’t mind.","ACD"
id389,"I could not lie to a lady.","ACD"
id874,"There was a       thrill in the doctor’s voice which showed that he was himself       deeply moved by that which he told us.","ACD"
id440,"Come, come!","ACD"
id5641,"You have made your inquiries to prove the correctness of my statement--haven’t you?","WKL"
id690,"It is not my       intention to be fulsome, but I confess that I covet your skull.","ACD"
id2993,"Then, as soon as the body was recovered from the line, a man pushed forward to examine it, saying he was a doctor.","ACR"
id3769,"You, in my place, might have distinguished yourself!","ACR"
id155,"Well, Mr. Malone, from all I hear, you seem to be doing very well, said he in his kindly Scotch accent.","ACD"
id3086,"But no notecase.","ACR"
id1824,"I have hopes, Etienne.","ACD"
id5110,"Again Sarah paused before she answered--again the trembling pressure made itself felt on her hand, but more weakly this time--again the words dropped affrightedly from her lips--  I swear it.","WKL"
id2162,"It was necessary to move with caution, for the walls above were lined by the Spanish sentries, who fired down continually at our advance posts.","ACD"
id3832,"The coincidence of the date of the appearance of ‘the Western Star’ struck me at once.","ACR"
id5149,"repeated the doctor.","WKL"
id885,"You say it was large?","ACD"
id4963,"Mrs. Treverton's clear gray eyes began to flash; the rosy flush deepened on her cheeks; the commanding hand was raised again, by an effort, from the counterpane on which it lay.","WKL"
id3695,"Events proved my forebodings to be justified.","ACR"
id6943,"You!","WKL"
id513,"Somehow we gathered up a chair upon our way, and bounded on with it towards the street.","ACD"
id1259,"I did a good deal of shopping.","ACD"
id2321,"Four was the hour when the storming-party would be in its place.","ACD"
id175,"The expense of the 'special meesion' business hardly justifies the result, and, of course, in any case it would only be an experienced man with a name that would command public confidence who would get such an order.","ACD"
id1981,"The Hussars of Conflans were encamped to the south of the town, and it was their duty to throw out patrols and to make sure that no Spanish force was advancing from that quarter.","ACD"
id1300,"Perfectly.","ACD"
id3649,"The butler reappeared.","ACR"
id906,"No marks could show on the grass.","ACD"
id5699,"Mr. Delamayn stated the law, as that law still stands--to the disgrace of the English Legislature and the English Nation.","WKL"
id3447,"Maude Stopperton, fourth daughter of 3rd Baron Cotteril’ .","ACR"
id6397,"Mr. Vanstone searched his pockets and shook his head.","WKL"
id3261,"Ah, Friday next.","ACR"
id480,"Swollen gas-bags!","ACD"
id2277,"A little more of that wine, please!","ACD"
id2155,"There is a sergeant outside who will show you how to get into the city.","ACD"
id1203,"Have you read anything       else in this message, Mr. Holmes?","ACD"
id2358,"The cell next door to the magazine on the far side from the chapel must be the one which belonged to Sister Angela.","ACD"
id1078,"Yes, the setting is a worthy one.","ACD"
id6601,"He had left Miss Garth’s question on that point unanswered.","WKL"
id6419,"And the other six all for papa.","WKL"
id4404,"I did not see Mrs. Cavendish until lunch-time, when she volunteered to take me for a walk, and we spent a charming afternoon roaming in the woods, returning to the house about five.","ACR"
id6204,"Spoke clearly, sensibly, and modestly, and was never too long.","WKL"
id612,"You know my methods.","ACD"
id6053,"The noise outside came nearer.","WKL"
id4726,"No one need sit up.","ACR"
id1958,"There may still be times when the peace of the cloister is broken by the memory of the old soldier who loved her in those distant days.","ACD"
id104,"Think of the woman he loved, and how other women must have envied her!","ACD"
id6706,"In the meantime they would all, she trusted, be happily reunited on the twenty-third of the month, which Mr. Vanstone had fixed on as the day for their return.","WKL"
id43,"I didn't invent it, I pleaded.","ACD"
id4653,"I tell you it is not what you imagine.","ACR"
id4090,"I went up to town early Wednesday morning, as my boat sailed from Tilbury about twelve o’clock.","ACR"
id1715,"By what right are you here?","ACD"
id2925,"Mrs. James identified it as that of the lady who had come the day before.","ACR"
id6576,"The front view of him was the view in which he looked oldest; meeting him face to face, he might have been estimated at fifty or more.","WKL"
id5125,"The doctor, followed by the nurse and by one of the servants, entered the room; and, hurrying to the bedside, saw at a glance that the time for his attendance there had passed away forever.","WKL"
id1951,"One of them, at any rate, said I, as I stooped and kissed her hand.","ACD"
id6393,"Look here, mamma—look here, Miss Garth!","WKL"
id3864,"She has a magnificent advertisement.","ACR"
id914,"About four feet high.","ACD"
id3846,"The lady switches off the light, bangs the door, throws the necklace down the passage, and screams.","ACR"
id4326,"Criminal discovered in last chapter.","ACR"
id4235,"A lady in a stout tweed skirt, who was bending over a flower bed, straightened herself at our approach.","ACR"
id870,"A man’s or a woman’s?","ACD"
id2878,"the coroner asked me.","ACR"
id98,"There are heroisms all round us waiting to be done.","ACD"
id6674,"As the son of her mother’s first husband, by that husband’s first wife, not even the widest stretch of courtesy could have included him at any time in the list of Mrs. Vanstone’s most distant relations.","WKL"
id5279,"In the time of Captain Treverton's father the whole range of the north rooms had been stripped of their finest pictures and their most valuable furniture, to assist in redecorating the west rooms, which now formed the only inhabited part of the house, and which were amply sufficient for the accommodation of the family and of any visitors who came to stay with them.","WKL"
id4978,"Stop!","WKL"
id1640,"A single slanting hole high up near the ceiling was the only aperture for light or air.","ACD"
id3028,"She explained that she wanted to rent or purchase a house on the Thames within easy reach of London.","ACR"
id6922,"Dear me, I’m wandering.","WKL"
id4030,"Then you can give us no clue as to why he suddenly decided to insure his life?","ACR"
id3659,"You think so, Hastings?","ACR"
id68,"Now tell me what's amiss with me?","ACD"
id2707,"I jumped at the chance.","ACR"
id1183,"I could understand anyone saying that the words were from a       newspaper; but that you should name which, and add that it came       from the leading article, is really one of the most remarkable       things which I have ever known.","ACD"
id5896,"Mr. Delamayn, resolutely waiting his opportunity to speak, seized it once more--and held it this time.","WKL"
id2165,"It is an easy tree to climb, said he.","ACD"
id506,"Don't be such a fool, Professor!","ACD"
id6330,"Her eyebrows and eyelashes were just a shade darker than her hair, and seemed made expressly for those violet-blue eyes, which assert their most irresistible charm when associated with a fair complexion.","WKL"
id4768,"In a moment or two he was back.","ACR"
id325,"--by re-reading your masterly address at Vienna.","ACD"
id1810,"For pity's sake tell me what these butchers are about to do.","ACD"
id4916,"The slight marks of illness in her face, the inevitable changes in the grace and roundness of its outline, were rendered hardly noticeable by the marvelous preservation of her complexion in all the light and delicacy of its first girlish beauty.","WKL"
id1051,"Well, it is rather obvious.","ACD"
id3496,"There’s never been any romantic story attaching to the diamond.","ACR"
id4471,"The colour rose in her cheeks as she held out her hand to him.","ACR"
id167,"What sort of meesion had you in your mind, Mr. Malone?","ACD"
id2501,"he said softly.","ACR"
id1188,"Because that is my special hobby.","ACD"
id6703,"Having disclosed these particulars, Mrs. Vanstone requested that they might be kept a secret between her correspondent and herself.","WKL"
id4575,"Then she looked at her watch.","ACR"
id3690,"I gave in rather grudgingly.","ACR"
id836,"The moor is very sparsely inhabited, and those who live near       each other are thrown very much together.","ACD"
id512,"We did a Catharine-wheel together down the passage.","ACD"
id4662,"Was Dorcas there, then?","ACR"
id5855,"I really can’t--  Mr. Vanborough--passing close behind him and whispering as he passed--stopped the lawyer before he could say a word more.","WKL"
id3314,".","ACR"
id1634,"I was led along a passage and down a bare stone stair until we came to a short corridor from which three doors opened.","ACD"
id6289,"Vanstone and her eldest daughter.","WKL"
id2561,"There was the Kinema too, with a weekly episode of The Perils of Pamela.","ACR"
id6797,"shouted Mr. Vanstone.","WKL"
id3415,"We went over the facts again and again, but could get no further towards the elucidation of the mystery.","ACR"
id4967,"Give me the bottle.","WKL"
id2141,"It turns me into a spy, I cried.","ACD"
id6050,"He stretched out his hand to ring the bell and summon help.","WKL"
id6079,"He made a successful first speech in the House of Commons.","WKL"
id5105,"She struggled a little, recovered the power of utterance, and went on: Swear that you will not destroy this paper after I am dead.","WKL"
id5920,"He only repeated, Go into the garden!","WKL"
id1173,"Watson here knows more about my methods than you do,       but I fear that even he has not quite grasped the significance of       this sentence.","ACD"
id5602,"He is going to leave the Firm, and try his luck at the Bar.","WKL"
id4043,"A slight discrepancy, that is all!","ACR"
id3709,"If only you had listened to me.","ACR"
id4562,"Sister should read the rules outside the door.","ACR"
id2274,"They discovered me.","ACD"
id3293,"There’s some chance of our arranging to film a play down there in his ancestral pile.","ACR"
id5508,"Mr. Kendrew lifted his hand warningly.","WKL"
id4600,"I know Mademoiselle Cynthia.","ACR"
id6717,"If it was so, the conclusion that followed was a very distressing one.","WKL"
id5167,"When she roused herself at last, and pushed away the paper and rose to her feet, she stood quite still for an instant, before she ventured to look behind her.","WKL"
id4936,"Sarah bolted the door, returned irresolutely to the bedside, fixed her large, eager, startled eyes inquiringly on her mistress's face, and, suddenly bending over her, said in a whisper:  Have you told my master?","WKL"
id2665,"An aunt of mine who lives in Wales is in want of a young lady to help her.","ACR"
id201,"I don't suppose he can always be so violent as that.","ACD"
id895,"Is there anything between the hedges and the walk?","ACD"
id3521,"That’s it.","ACR"
id6939,"But I never tried to act.","WKL"
id250,"I would try.","ACD"
id1361,"There is no object in our following them, said Holmes.","ACD"
id1669,"He had gone as a hundred others had gone whose names were missing from the roll-calls of their regiments during that winter in Venice.","ACD"
id645,"Has been in the habit of carrying this stick behind his master.","ACD"
id2161,"Then in silence I followed my guide.","ACD"
id4945,"Mrs. Treverton's eyes had softened and moistened when she spoke of her love for her husband.","WKL"
id1910,"Then there was a crash upon the door upstairs, and a terrible voice roared: Open!","ACD"
id2763,"Still, green is a good colour for adventuresses.","ACR"
id4551,"No, Lawrence—that’s the poison cupboard.","ACR"
id6710,"Was the explanation which she had just read really as satisfactory and as complete as it professed to be?","WKL"
id6514,"Family affairs?","WKL"
id2739,"I heard her voice, slightly raised, as she entered the drawing-room below on the first floor.","ACR"
id3939,"Is that so?","ACR"
id3113,"Then, as soon as the body was recovered from the line, a man pushed forward to examine it, saying he was a doctor.","ACR"
id4947,"Ere long, she turned her head uneasily toward the chair in which her attendant was sitting, and spoke again--this time in a voice which had sunk to a whisper.","WKL"
id1722,"He was, indeed, a formidable old man, for his white beard bristled with fury and he barked out the little sentences like a savage hound.","ACD"
id4086,"I’ll do anything I can to help you, I’m sure, replied the young soldier; but I’m afraid I didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary.","ACR"
id5446,"They distrust every thing, from the scraper at the door to the chimneys on the roof.","WKL"
id5203,"The door was wide open, and the room was empty.","WKL"
id295,"I have to interview the fellow, and I need some lead up to him.","ACD"
id6615,"The man’s long face suddenly grew longer.","WKL"
id88,"Did you ever read the wonderful last chapter of that book about her husband?","ACD"
id4692,"We three sat for some time in silence.","ACR"
id622,"Is it, then, stretching       our inference too far to say that the presentation was on the       occasion of the change?","ACD"
id2027,"The assembly is at six, he answered.","ACD"
id3727,"We’re getting to the bottom of it, he said.","ACR"
id5821,"Astonishing!","WKL"
id6313,"No, my dear, you needn’t deny it.","WKL"
id5224,"The door of the nursery was situated there.","WKL"
id3838,"He soothes her by promising to arrange all—and prepares for a double robbery.","ACR"
id3258,"I complied.","ACR"
id3530,"He remained a moment or so in thought, then rose briskly to his feet.","ACR"

id4227,"No, she’ll have started from the hospital by now.","ACR"
id5322,"A cloud of dust flew all about her as she softly opened the door; a mouldy coolness made her shiver as she crossed a large stone hall, with some black old family portraits hanging on the walls, the canvases of which were bulging out of the frames.","WKL"
id6652,"Had Mrs. Vanstone ever referred to any poor relations who were dependent on her?","WKL"
id3685,"The full of the moon, it is not until Friday.","ACR"

id6982,"These two were followed by an accommodating spinster relative, who accepted the heavy dramatic responsibility of Mrs. Malaprop—and there the theatrical proceedings came to a pause.","WKL"
id3892,"I would let some time elapse before I forgave him.","ACR"
id187,"You seem to have a sort of genius for establishing relations with people--seempathy, I suppose, or animal magnetism, or youthful vitality, or something.","ACD"
id3192,"Without doubt.","ACR"
id1376,"Could you ring him up?—thank you!","ACD"
id2189,"The same instant I buried my knife in his body, and he fell with a loud crashing through the branches and came with a thud to the ground.","ACD"
id3038,"He explained to Mrs. James that he was a friend of the lady who had come to look over the house, but had stopped at the post office to send a telegram.","ACR"
id1353,"2704 is       our man.","ACD"
id5075,"He talked about praying for me, and coming back.","WKL"
id6653,"On the contrary she had mentioned of late years that she doubted having any relations at all who were still living.","WKL"
id3922,"I have ascertained that there is only one doctor in Marsdon Leigh, Dr. Ralph Bernard.","ACR"
id2920,"Five minutes later he reappeared, handed her back the keys and explained that he feared the house would not suit them.","ACR"
id3728,"But it’s almost unbelievable.","ACR"
id2573,"No, here we have what I have always maintained—the ancestral form of the Neanderthal race.","ACR"
id2115,"If that could be exploded the way would be clear for us.","ACD"

id6358,"and what has the concert done for _you?_ What form of suffering has dissipation inflicted on _your_ system this morning?","WKL"
id2753,"Mr. Flemming seemed puzzled.","ACR"

id6881,"Mr. Marrable’s a merchant at Bristol.","WKL"
id4032,"Well, we had only been married a little over a year.","ACR"
id1504,"In an instant he had torn away my sword, had slipped a sack over my head, and had tied a rope firmly round the outside of it.","ACD"
id728,"It is one of several indications       which enabled me to fix the date.","ACD"
id5447,"They force their way in at all hours.","WKL"
id2892,"I had my own theory in regard to the doctor.","ACR"
id4710,"Have some coffee, and tell us what you have been up to.","ACR"

id1241,"Sir Henry smiled.","ACD"
id5538,"My father forgave me on his death-bed, and I had to bring her home again.","WKL"
id3823,"Her husband was amusing himself elsewhere.","ACR"
id3312,"I rose, went to the table at the other side of the room and returned with the paper in question in my hand.","ACR"
id2137,"He produced what appeared to be a roll of dirty brown flannel.","ACD"
id517,"I have seen the two Macs attempt something of the kind at the halls, but it appears to take some practise to do it without hurting oneself.","ACD"
id3578,"They’re sending down a chap to-night to vet the stone.","ACR"
id6835,"If there is anything to eat in the kitchen, get it and go to bed.","WKL"
id3582,"I wish you wouldn’t sell it, George, she said, in a low voice.","ACR"
id1939,"But Lucia had burst through from her cell and was pouring out the whole story while she clasped Lorenzo's arm.","ACD"
id2632,"It took some time to dawn upon me that the thing I had always longed for—freedom—was at last mine.","ACR"
id1156,"asked Sir Henry sharply.","ACD"
id3429,"I was secretly rather pleased with myself, though I tried to conceal the fact for fear of irritating him.","ACR"
id1694,"The case is decided and another is up for judgment.","ACD"
id2761,"It is true that a curate once told me that my eyes were like imprisoned sunshine in a dark, dark wood—but curates always know so many quotations, and fire them off at random.","ACR"
id6621,"I think you have now asked me questions enough, she went on, beginning to let her temper get the better of her at last.","WKL"
id2719,"Why not return with me to-day?","ACR"
id6269,"Another member of the family appeared on the stairs—Miss Garth, the governess.","WKL"

id1033,"said he.","ACD"
id3575,"I feel you ought to know about this.","ACR"

id4508,"The sinister face of Dr. Bauerstein recurred to me unpleasantly.","ACR"
id4325,"Lots of nonsense written, though.","ACR"
id2856,"The kind woman insisted on my having a cup of tea.","ACR"
id3681,"_Tiens!_ cried Poirot, stepping back a pace and regarding me with admiration.","ACR"
id2803,"If there is one smell I cannot bear it is that of moth balls!","ACR"
id809,"He never returned.","ACD"

id2259,"I staggered back in amazement.","ACD"
id1298,"I’ll be able to tell you       more clearly then how this thing strikes me.","ACD"
id2804,"This man’s heavy overcoat simply reeked of them.","ACR"
id6408,"Thank you for a very pretty speech.","WKL"
id751,"Then, as it would seem, he became as one             that hath a devil, for, rushing down the stairs into the             dining-hall, he sprang upon the great table, flagons and             trenchers flying before him, and he cried aloud before all             the company that he would that very night render his body             and soul to the Powers of Evil if he might but overtake the             wench.","ACD"

id4669,"Evidently something very momentous had occurred that afternoon.","ACR"
id4005,"Poirot pressed her hand sympathetically.","ACR"
id2903,"The police are reported to have a clue.","ACR"
id2981,"Just say straight out what it is you’ve got in your head.","ACR"
id4859,"Few men, at first sight of her, could have resisted the desire to find out who she was; few would have been satisfied with receiving for answer, She is Mrs. Treverton's maid; few would have refrained from the attempt to extract some secret information for themselves from her face and manner; and none, not even the most patient and practiced of observers, could have succeeded in discovering more than that she must have passed through the ordeal of some great suffering at some former period of her life.","WKL"
id6783,"I wish to give no offense; I speak quite impartially—but mark my words, Vanstone: they’ll all three turn out ill, in spite of everything you can do to prevent it.","WKL"
id4928,"Bolt the door.","WKL"
id2691,"He explained at unnecessary length.","ACR"
id1961,"How the Brigadier Captured Saragossa  Have I ever told you, my friends, the circumstances connected with my joining the Hussars of Conflans at the time of the siege of Saragossa and the very remarkable exploit which I performed in connection with the taking of that city?","ACD"
id726,"Holmes stretched out his hand for the manuscript and flattened it       upon his knee.","ACD"
id2352,"I walked on without hesitation, for I knew by my observations in the garden which way to go for the chapel.","ACD"
id3004,"Yes, I didn’t notice it specially at the time—except that I felt there was something wrong.","ACR"
id4346,"Why, Mary, what a gruesome conversation!","ACR"
id297,"I'll go with you now, if it is not too late.","ACD"
id6794,"I say, No mathematics, no industry, no ambition, no firmness of purpose.","WKL"
id3596,"Behold the sacrifice, she said gaily.","ACR"
id6955,"she said, with a coquettish beckoning action of her head.","WKL"

id1869,"I am sorry, signora, but the order of the tribunal has to be obeyed.","ACD"
id2816,"It was distorted by fear—almost panic.","ACR"
id6991,"A lady whose age was unknown, and whose personal appearance was stout—but whose heart was in the right place—volunteered to act the part of the sentimental Julia, and brought with her the dramatic qualification of habitually wearing a wig in private life.","WKL"
id3005,"But I worked it out when I got home, and then I saw why the whole thing had looked so unhandy to me at the time.","ACR"
id6698,"It had returned again and again in spite of her.","WKL"
id296,"It's really awfully good of you to give me a lift.","ACD"
id1581,"Every house is an island.","ACD"
id6299,"She was not so tall.","WKL"
id2489,"He was a man who once—loved me.","ACR"
id5098,"Sarah dropped on her knees by the bed.","WKL"
id2831,"Nothing to be done.","ACR"
id1323,"Come along!","ACD"
id5950,"He hesitates!","WKL"
id3268,"You have it with you—_hein_?","ACR"
id658,"The appearance of our visitor was a surprise to me, since I had       expected a typical country practitioner.","ACD"
id6796,"Hang your negatives!","WKL"
id5054,"If I only knew that I was fit to die, she said, oh, how gladly I would change places with you!","WKL"
id3475,"Then you really think there is a chance of it being stolen?","ACR"
id6175,"He was called to the Bar.","WKL"
id6519,"I suppose I’m getting old.","WKL"
id4865,"Her cheeks had lost their roundness and their natural color; her lips, singularly flexible in movement and delicate in form, had faded to an unhealthy paleness; her eyes, large and black and overshadowed by unusually thick lashes, had contracted an anxious startled look, which never left them, and which piteously expressed the painful acuteness of her sensibility, the inherent timidity of her disposition.","WKL"
id1004,"Twenty-four hours.","ACD"
id732,"Yes, it is a statement of a certain legend which runs in the       Baskerville family.","ACD"
id5731,"I find that one man may have known another from the days when they were both boys, and may have seen nothing but the false surface of him in all that time.","WKL"
id6656,"A false statement, on the stranger’s part, without any intelligible reason for making it?","WKL"
id3739,"I’d never noticed it before.","ACR"
id4246,"I’m sure I shall be only too delighted to make myself useful, I responded.","ACR"
id3367,"Oh, show her in here, Mrs. Murchison.","ACR"
id2838,"The doctor who had examined the body was just ahead of me.","ACR"
id5619,"Involved in public and producible troubles, you would have said, Here is my man.","WKL"
id2196,"At the same time, if it were found, it would warn the enemy that something had happened, so I thought it best to drop it over the wall.","ACD"
id5551,"It’s no use talking to me of my wife’s virtues.","WKL"
id5909,"cried Mrs. Vanborough--loudly, sternly, incredulously.","WKL"
id5516,"I suspect you are getting tired of your wife.","WKL"
id1555,"Then, without movement, very slowly and stealthily I had a peep at the men who surrounded me.","ACD"
id583,"I am bound to say that in       all the accounts which you have been so good as to give of my own       small achievements you have habitually underrated your own       abilities.","ACD"
id3679,"What had happened to his usually keen wits?","ACR"
id1067,"Exactly.","ACD"
id6242,"Seven o’clock struck; and the signs of domestic life began to show themselves in more rapid succession.","WKL"
id1294,"It’s a big thing for a man       to have to understand and to decide at one sitting.","ACD"

id4959,"Give me the bottle.","WKL"
id5187,"She clasped the letter suddenly to her breast with both hands, and shrank back against the wall of the room, her eyes still fastened on the curtain with the same blank look of horror which they had exhibited when Mrs. Treverton had threatened to claim her servant's obedience from the other world.","WKL"
id3541,"Monsieur Poirot and Captain Hastings, announced the butler.","ACR"
id6836,"You can walk over to Combe-Raven tomorrow and give this message from me to Mr. Vanstone: ‘Father’s compliments, sir, and I have come back upon your hands like a bad shilling, as he always said I should.","WKL"
id3002,"Besides, a doctor doesn’t usually feel for the heart on the right side of the body.","ACR"
id5108,"At that final appeal, she answered faintly,  I swear it.","WKL"
id6964,"While he still hesitated, Mr. Vanstone and his daughter reached the top of the steps.","WKL"
id863,"There was certainly no physical injury of any       kind.","ACD"
id5290,"Wandering more and more slowly along the pathways of the forsaken garden, as the course of her ideas withdrew her more and more completely from all outward things, she stopped insensibly on an open patch of ground, which had once been a well-kept lawn, and which still commanded a full view of the long range of uninhabited north rooms.","WKL"
id5493,"If you ever marry, he said, don’t be such a fool, Kendrew, as I have been.","WKL"
id2250,"Again I heard a groan, but this time there could be no doubt that it was above my head.","ACD"
id3193,"She is coming here.","ACR"
id623,"It certainly seems probable.","ACD"
id6183,"Mr. Delamayn answered, Put me into Parliament.","WKL"
id1775,"I cried.","ACD"
id3164,"She is being followed by a bevy of admirers who have recognized her.","ACR"
id669,"From one or two friends there on the occasion of my marriage.","ACD"
id2234,"Seldom in my life have I been more perplexed.","ACD"
id1119,"It       becomes coherent.","ACD"
id449,"He leaned forward with great earnestness.","ACD"
id5945,"Is that lady your wife?","WKL"
id6872,"Mr. Marrable, Mrs. Marrable, and Miss Marrable; Evergreen Lodge, Clifton.","WKL"
id5760,"I was to tell you she was much pressed for time.","WKL"
id3026,"The inquest elicited the following facts.","ACR"
id5372,"The house was still occupied by the persons who desired to let it.","WKL"
id6970,"Miss Marrable was that hardest of all born tyrants—an only child.","WKL"
id3945,"You had been attending Mr. Maltravers recently?","ACR"
id2695,"I waited in some trepidation for what was coming next.","ACR"
id1070,"Within a radius of five miles there are, as you       see, only a very few scattered dwellings.","ACD"
id6774,"As it is, I have no money to help them with; and they have no brains to help themselves.","WKL"
id1755,"Let him have no food or water, and let him be led before the tribunal again on Wednesday night.","ACD"
id5642,"Yes.","WKL"
id1646,"It was only in this one direction of the wooden screen that there was any possibility of exploring.","ACD"
id3952,"And the cause of death was clear?","ACR"
id4887,"She shook her head, and thanked him again, then passed before him quickly on her way out of the gallery.","WKL"
id5247,"There one of the servants who had been sitting up met her, and, with a face of astonishment and alarm, asked what was the matter.","WKL"
id95,"It is the mark of the kind of man I mean that he makes his own chances.","ACD"
id6275,"This was evidently not one of the forlorn, persecuted, pitiably dependent order of governesses.","WKL"
id1620,"There are two names upon our list before him.","ACD"
id664,"I was not       sure whether I had left it here or in the Shipping Office.","ACD"
id1450,"My business, for example, has usually been with soldiers and peasants, and what advantage is it to be able to say to them that I love only them, and that I will come back when the wars are over?","ACD"

id1960,"II.","ACD"
id4418,"My dear Evelyn, cried Mrs. Cavendish, this can’t be true!","ACR"
id1788,"They have trapped us both with the same bait.","ACD"
id6141,"Don’t let her act!","WKL"
id2667,"No, doctor, I’m going to London.","ACR"
id2004,"They listened unmoved.","ACD"
id2579,"They passed to Europe on——  Here he broke down with a bad fit of choking, the result of an immoderate mouthful of kipper-bones.","ACR"
id5675,"Did he ask if you were both Roman Catholics?","WKL"
id3100,"You’ve asked questions and hinted things.","ACR"
id46,"Well, perhaps if both love, it may be different.","ACD"
id5103,"said Mrs. Treverton.","WKL"
id5237,"One of her hands held over his shoulder the doll that she had taken to bed with her, the other was twined gently in his hair.","WKL"
id3286,"On Friday we’re going down to Yardly Chase to spend a few days with Lord and Lady Yardly.","ACR"
id6272,"Though little more than forty years of age, her hair was quite gray; and she wore over it the plain cap of an old woman.","WKL"
id3467,"I telegraphed to him.","ACR"
id5820,"A last house at Hampstead is left on my list--and in that house I meet you.","WKL"
id1534,"They will kill him, will they not?","ACD"
id253,"I noticed a tall, thin, angular man seated in an arm-chair by the fire.","ACD"
id5579,"Is Mrs. Vanborough concerned in the matter?","WKL"
id5286,"The untrained ivy, the rank vegetation growing in fissures of the stone-work, the festoons of spiders' webs, the rubbish of wood, bricks, plaster, broken glass, rags, and strips of soiled cloth, which lay beneath the windows, all told the same tale of neglect.","WKL"
id5325,"She had great difficulty in accomplishing this, from the violence of her agitation, which made her hands tremble to such a degree that she was hardly able to keep the keys separate one from the other.","WKL"
id1380,"Let me have the Hotel Directory, said Holmes.","ACD"
id2017,"Again there was a roar of laughter.","ACD"
id687,"I had hardly expected so dolichocephalic a skull or       such well-marked supra-orbital development.","ACD"
id2585,"We must get ahead of them.","ACR"
id6228,"CHAPTER I.","WKL"

id3585,"She shrugged her shoulders.","ACR"
id6628,"This time his bilious green eye took the initiative, and set his bilious brown eye the example of recovered serenity.","WKL"
id4846,"She is gone to her own room, then, rejoined the other.","WKL"
id5576,"He poured himself out another glass of wine, and drank it at a draught before he replied.","WKL"
id6888,"The first ten minutes of seclusion in the conservatory passed without events of any kind.","WKL"
id3859,"I pondered the matter.","ACR"
id4697,"Alas, that these harmonious moments can never endure!","ACR"
id813,"There were indications that Sir Charles had             stood for some little time here.","ACD"
id828,"This article, you say,       contains all the public facts?","ACD"
id5393,"When Blanche’s mother and I last saw each other we were two poor school-girls beginning the world.","WKL"
id5489,"Mr. Kendrew was short and light--slow and awkward in manner, except when something happened to rouse him.","WKL"
id1068,"I fancy the yew alley, though not marked under that       name, must stretch along this line, with the moor, as you       perceive, upon the right of it.","ACD"
id1292,"It was evident that the fiery temper       of the Baskervilles was not extinct in this their last       representative.","ACD"
id6161,"He disappeared from his club.","WKL"
id880,"How was it that no one else saw it?","ACD"
id2103,"For the moment I was a heroic figure.","ACD"
id2795,"I was returning from an unsuccessful interview with a lady who said she wanted a secretary-companion, but really seemed to require a strong charwoman who would work twelve hours a day for ?25 a year.","ACR"
id1942,"He has suffered that I might be saved.","ACD"
id584,"It may be that you are not yourself luminous, but you       are a conductor of light.","ACD"
id1444,"This made the people furious, and there was very bad feeling in the town.","ACD"
id2399,"Long life to the ‘Colonel,’ said the Count, smiling.","ACR"
id6219,"The Ministry had made a previous appointment which had been universally unpopular.","WKL"
id2642,"That seemed to fluster him a good deal, and he murmured that a wife was a great help to a General Practitioner.","ACR"

id132,"I'll do something in the world yet!","ACD"
id232,"Began to tell his adventures in a vague way, but somebody started to pick holes, and he just shut up like an oyster.","ACD"
id4580,"I had seen Lawrence in quite a different light that afternoon.","ACR"
id3583,"It’s been in the family so long.","ACR"
id5444,"Such people!","WKL"
id1438,"The people at Venice were very much attached to them, and as to the four bronze horses which stood over the gate of their great church, they loved them as dearly as if they had been their children.","ACD"
id6160,"He took a few blades of grass from the turf with which they covered her grave--when he thought that nobody was looking at him.","WKL"
id3976,"Exactly.","ACR"
id3711,"It appears so, _mon ami_, said Poirot cautiously.","ACR"
id6946,"Pray, papa, be serious!","WKL"
id6360,"repeated Magdalen, recovering her breath, and the use of her tongue with it.","WKL"
id3601,"Suddenly without any warning, every light was extinguished, the door banged, and from the other side of it came a long-drawn piercing woman’s scream.","ACR"
id6696,"When the doubt had first suggested itself she had treated it as a mere delusion.","WKL"
id4756,"What was to be done?","ACR"
id1893,"Rouse up, signora, rouse up!","ACD"
id4819,"She has lived, Robert, to see ten minutes of the new day.","WKL"
id171,"You seem very anxious to lose your life.","ACD"
id2075,"The colonel's features relaxed.","ACD"
id2056,"We shall be there, Captain Gerard, at the hour you name.","ACD"
id713,"It is an old manuscript.","ACD"
id1228,"Well?","ACD"
id1571,"It turned to the left and again to the left, and then I found myself back in the hall once more.","ACD"
id3033,"She produced an order from the house-agents, and, as was the usual custom, Mrs. James gave her the keys of the house.","ACR"
id641,"I think that I am fairly justified in my inferences.","ACD"
id2482,"cried the dancer sharply.","ACR"
id6894,"Guess, you darling—guess what they’re going to give at Evergreen Lodge!","WKL"
id1774,"Lucia!","ACD"
id6436,"He quietly removed his daughter’s arm from his neck, as if he wished to be free from all interruption.","WKL"

id1139,"No one could have known.","ACD"
id1389,"Yes, sir.","ACD"
id3436,"‘Yardly .","ACR"
id1783,"I wrote no letter.","ACD"
id5876,"Lady Jane turned to Mr. Vanborough.","WKL"
id6165,"He applied for, and obtained, an appointment in one of the colonies.","WKL"
id2978,"The inspector fell in with the suggestion readily enough.","ACR"
id1882,"It is the custom of men to say to ladies that they would willingly endure any pain for their sake, but it was my privilege to show that I had said no more than I meant.","ACD"
id6039,"(See what a thing habit is!","WKL"
id843,"Incredible as it may appear to you, Mr. Holmes, he was       honestly convinced that a dreadful fate overhung his family, and       certainly the records which he was able to give of his ancestors       were not encouraging.","ACD"
id1662,"cried the voice again, and then Gerard!","ACD"
id1658,"Help!","ACD"
id5989,"The grand woman, who in the old stage days had held thousands breathless over the mimic woes of the scene, stood there grander than ever, in her own woe, and held the three people who looked at her breathless till she spoke again.","WKL"
id2758,"Was I really good-looking?","ACR"
id5280,"The mansion had been originally built in the form of a square, and had been strongly fortified.","WKL"
id2661,"You’d know it if you married me!","ACR"
id4035,"I gather that he had had one h?morrhage already, and that he knew that another one would prove fatal.","ACR"
id3793,"But I don’t understand——  No?","ACR"
id3196,"This street, it is not aristocratic, _mon ami_!","ACR"
id5066,"and I said, 'All but one.'","WKL"
id6788,"My good fellow, he won’t take it, retorted Mr. Clare, with the icy composure of a disinterested friend.","WKL"
id6623,"If you have any message to leave for Mrs. Vanstone, I shall be writing to her by to-night’s post, and I can take charge of it.","WKL"
id2436,"But your contract here?","ACR"
id5578,"Mr. Kendrew looked surprised.","WKL"
id1600,"With dignity I advanced toward the tribunal.","ACD"
id4280,"Alfred, darling, Mr. Hastings—my husband.","ACR"
id1208,"Again, you will       observe that the words are not gummed on in an accurate line, but       that some are much higher than others.","ACD"
id3744,"And indeed there was nothing even remotely Oriental about the frank brown eyes that looked into ours.","ACR"
id1043,"He laughed at my bewildered expression.","ACD"
id352,"The context convinces me, however, that you have sinned rather through ignorance and tactlessness than through malice, so I am content to pass the matter by.","ACD"
id5563,"Imagine what would happen if your wife heard that!","WKL"
id5500,"I want a woman highly connected and highly bred--a woman who can receive the best society in England, and open her husband’s way to a position in the world.","WKL"
id3047,"The police surgeon gave it as his opinion that the woman had been dead about twenty-four hours.","ACR"
id3975,"Rather an old ass.","ACR"
id3677,"Don’t you see?","ACR"
id5428,"Would you like to eat your fruit in the garden, Blanche?","WKL"
id670,"Dear, dear, that’s bad!","ACD"
id5659,"and _you_ were baptized and brought up in the Church of England?","WKL"
id3902,"There was, of course, the usual suicide clause in the policy.","ACR"
id807,"On the fourth of May Sir Charles had declared his             intention of starting next day for London, and had ordered             Barrymore to prepare his luggage.","ACD"
id4890,"It was opened by Captain Treverton.","WKL"
id1512,"I had felt the fellow's grip upon my arms, and I knew that I would be a child in his hands.","ACD"
id4912,"The strong nature of the mistress and the weak nature of the maid came out, even in that short interchange of words spoken through the curtain of a death-bed.","WKL"
id2258,"It was as high as my face, and yet, so far as I could feel, it had nothing to support it.","ACD"
id6025,"There was dead silence in the room as he did it.","WKL"
id3669,"I said impatiently.","ACR"
id4206,"It’s simply bare-faced fortune hunting; but there you are—she is her own mistress, and she’s married him.","ACR"
id3376,"Tall, dark, with flashing eyes, and a pale proud face—yet something wistful in the curves of the mouth.","ACR"
id260,"Challenger was the man who came with some cock-and-bull story from South America.","ACD"
id6401,"You really should check Magdalen, pleaded Mrs. Vanstone, addressing her husband when her daughter had left the room.","WKL"
id2018,"I can see the ring of faces, the mocking eyes, the open mouths--Olivier with his great black bristles, Pelletan thin and sneering, even the young sub-lieutenants convulsed with merriment.","ACD"
id5854,"I beg your ladyship’s pardon, he began.","WKL"
id6303,"The mother and daughter slowly descended the stairs together—the first dressed in dark brown, with an Indian shawl thrown over her shoulders; the second more simply attired in black, with a plain collar and cuffs, and a dark orange-colored ribbon over the bosom of her dress.","WKL"
id405,"His appearance made me gasp.","ACD"
id3678,"His unusual obtuseness annoyed me.","ACR"
id383,"It is most considerate of you, madam.","ACD"
id6920,"First, because he’s a darling; secondly, because I love him, and he loves me; thirdly, because there is never any difference of opinion between us (is there?","WKL"
id4948,"Look for my medicine, said she; I want it.","WKL"
id1153,"You must allow that there       is nothing supernatural about this, at any rate?","ACD"
id6841,"It was not wonderful that Magdalen should have failed to recognize him when he first appeared in view.","WKL"
id111,"You never said so.","ACD"
id2082,"We passed through the camp and made our way across the trenches and over the ruined heaps of stones which marked the old wall of the town.","ACD"
id465,"It proves, he roared, with a sudden blast of fury, that you are the damnedest imposter in London--a vile, crawling journalist, who has no more science than he has decency in his composition!","ACD"
id185,"McArdle was plunged in thought for some minutes.","ACD"
id940,"Besides, besides—        Why do you hesitate?","ACD"
id5242,"Don't cry any more for poor mamma.","WKL"
id6049,"Still, there she lay--the wife who had loved him, the mother of his child--there she lay.","WKL"
id2766,"I put a lot of powder on my face, so that the skin seemed even whiter than usual.","ACR"
id6351,"Surely, this self-contradictory girl had perversely accomplished one contradiction more, by developing into a character which was out of all harmony with her own Christian name!","WKL"
id6931,"Of course I said: ‘I’ve got the gentleman, and he shall grapple immediately.’—‘Oh heavens!","WKL"
id6636,"I have found the country hereabouts remarkably pretty; I have seen Mrs. Vanstone’s two charming daughters; I have become acquainted with an honored preceptress in Mr. Vanstone’s family.","WKL"
id4993,"Get my writing-case, and the pen and ink, from the cabinet near the window.","WKL"
id3381,"I leant forward on a sudden impulse.","ACR"
id2796,"Having parted with mutual veiled impolitenesses, I walked down Edgware Road (the interview had taken place in a house in St. John’s Wood) and across Hyde Park to St. George’s Hospital.","ACR"
id4151,"‘Story’ recalls to him one of the ‘Lion’ stories he told at dinner.","ACR"
id6297,"Inheriting the dark majestic character of her mother’s beauty, she had yet hardly inherited all its charms.","WKL"
id4002,"Will you recount to me briefly the sad events of Wednesday?","ACR"
id2269,"He had still strength enough to swallow, and the light came back a little to his dim eyes.","ACD"
id1492,"But save for this it was all black, and one could only see the water by the white fringe which curled round the long black nose of our boat.","ACD"
id6245,"The kitchen-maid came next—afflicted with the face-ache, and making no secret of her sufferings.","WKL"
id3073,"Of course you know about the man who was killed in the Tube?","ACR"
id540,"What's that?","ACD"
id1432,"It is true that I was very young when I joined the army, and that the quarter-master was my only teacher, but if you go about the world with your eyes open you cannot help learning a great deal.","ACD"
id5243,"Think of poor papa, and try to comfort him.","WKL"
id2347,"I filled two of these, and approached the door.","ACD"
id4854,"This time the signal was answered.","WKL"
id1302,"Shall I have a cab called?","ACD"
id3754,"I have not been of much use, I fear, he said regretfully.","ACR"
id5388,"The younger was light and florid, with round red cheeks and bright, saucy eyes--a charming little picture of happiness and health.","WKL"
id6474,"Ah!","WKL"
id3621,"For in the middle of the necklace was a great gap.","ACR"
id6254,"The next member of the family who came downstairs was Mr. Andrew Vanstone, the master of the house.","WKL"
id4628,"The old servant hesitated, then added diffidently: Don’t you think, m’m, you’d better get to bed?","ACR"
id4398,"He looked up at my window as he passed, and I recognized him, though he had changed much in the fifteen years that had elapsed since we last met.","ACR"
id3614,"I accompanied him, my heart beating wildly.","ACR"
id2546,"I have seldom seen Papa so angry.","ACR"
id796,"Being himself childless, it was         his openly expressed desire that the whole countryside should,         within his own lifetime, profit by his good fortune, and many         will have personal reasons for bewailing his untimely end.","ACD"
id2207,"It was a narrow and deserted lane, but it opened into a broader road, which was dotted with fires, round which a great number of soldiers and peasants were sleeping.","ACD"
id2973,"Well, I’m inclined to think you’re a little too fond of the word, Miss Beddingfeld.","ACR"
id1973,"The immense city was crowded with a horde of Spaniards--soldiers, peasants, priests--all filled with the most furious hatred of the French, and the most savage determination to perish before they would surrender.","ACD"
id5397,"Lady Lundie is now on her way back to England, for the first time since she left it--I am afraid to say how many years since.","WKL"
id928,"This is a colleague, Watson, after our own heart.","ACD"
id2815,"He glanced at me and then his eyes went on to something behind me, and his face changed.","ACR"
id2485,"A foolish joke.","ACR"
id3759,"In about five minutes Poirot reappeared.","ACR"
id3843,"Lady Yardly, as I felt sure she would, immediately arranges a robbery—and does it very well too!","ACR"

id749,"At last in the             stress of her fear she did that which might have daunted             the bravest or most active man, for by the aid of the             growth of ivy which covered (and still covers) the south             wall she came down from under the eaves, and so homeward             across the moor, there being three leagues betwixt the Hall             and her father’s farm.","ACD"

id1154,"No, sir, but it might very well come from someone who was       convinced that the business is supernatural.","ACD"
id6122,"Why?","WKL"
id2430,"He smiled and shrugged his shoulders.","ACR"
id5806,"Mr. Vanborough, on his side, stood petrified.","WKL"
id685,"I have heard your name mentioned in       connection with that of your friend.","ACD"

id116,"I had to.","ACD"
id2406,"Without committing himself, he has planned and directed a series of stupendous _coups,_ embracing every branch of what we might call his ‘profession.’ Jewel robberies, forgery, espionage (the latter very profitable in war-time), sabotage, discreet assassination, there is hardly anything he has not touched.","ACR"

id3652,"He says you expect him.","ACR"
id3574,"Just a minute, Monsieur Poirot.","ACR"
id2702,"Every one has been very kind to me, I said gratefully.","ACR"
id3413,"Can it be true that some Chinese gang are really trying to recover the diamonds?","ACR"
id4012,"Yes, he usually took his little rook rifle with him, and I heard one or two shots in the distance.","ACR"
id5678,"No.","WKL"
id1184,"How did you do it?","ACD"
id6927,"Miss Marrable and I discussed Falkland privately on the window-seat while the rest were talking.","WKL"
id3653,"Good heavens!","ACR"
id1416,"But Suchet with the infantry held the town, and he had chosen me as his aide-de-camp for that winter, because he was pleased about the affair of the Italian fencing-master at Milan.","ACD"
id4757,"Oh, dear, sir, cried Dorcas, wringing her hands, what ever shall we do?","ACR"
id2817,"He stood a step backwards as though involuntarily recoiling from some danger, forgetting that he was standing on the extreme edge of the platform, and went down and over.","ACR"
id6502,"She said, It’s only me, papa; and waited for the answer.","WKL"
id1391,"You will say that an important telegram has miscarried       and that you are looking for it.","ACD"
id3135,"I had not intended to suggest anything of the kind.","ACR"
id4917,"There lay her face on the pillow--tenderly framed in by the rich lace of her cap, softly crowned by her shining brown hair--to all outward appearance, the face of a beautiful woman recovering from a slight illness, or reposing after unusual fatigue.","WKL"
id4434,"You can say what you like to me, but remember what I’ve told you.","ACR"
id91,"I gripped myself hard, and went on with the argument.","ACD"
id4267,"John, of course, good fellow though he is, could hardly be called a brilliant conversationalist.","ACR"
id5414,"One has often heard of hereditary hatred.","WKL"
id4146,"To begin with, Black answered well within the normal time limit, with no pauses, so we can take it that he himself has no guilty knowledge to conceal.","ACR"
id3230,"Cheap paper—the name and address carefully printed.","ACR"
id6911,"No, he can’t, said Magdalen.","WKL"
id4827,"Hush!","WKL"
id830,"Then let me have the private ones.","ACD"
id4787,"The violence of Mrs. Inglethorp’s attack seemed to be passing.","ACR"
id485,"You have played a rather dangerous game, and it strikes me that you have lost it.","ACD"
id4248,"Never does.","ACR"
id1865,"Bring a light, said one of them.","ACD"
id1266,"It is time that you kept your promise and gave me a full       account of what we are all driving at.","ACD"
id5853,"There she stopped for breath, and gave Mr. Delamayn his first opportunity of speaking to her.","WKL"
id6115,"A sudden trembling seized her.","WKL"
id3500,"he demanded wrathfully.","ACR"
id663,"I am so very glad, said he.","ACD"
id5778,"Might it not be desirable, he suggested, to consult Mrs. Vanborough before you quite decide?","WKL"
id3255,"The story seems of an almost unbelievable romanticism.","ACR"
id5939,"Her husband!","WKL"
id2700,"I’m alone in the world, I said, and was struck anew by my likeness to a film heroine.","ACR"
id469,"he cried, leaning forward, with his fingers on the table and his face projecting.","ACD"
id5687,"Well, he said to the lawyer, now for your opinion!","WKL"
id2913,"She produced an order from the house-agents, and, as was the usual custom, Mrs. James gave her the keys of the house.","ACR"
id5100,"The heavy beating hum of the distant surf came in at the same time, and poured out its unresting music in louder strains.","WKL"
id4491,"Styles is really a glorious old place, I said to John.","ACR"
id3815,"He stole it this morning with the assistance of a touch of grease paint at the corner of each eye!","ACR"
id1823,"They shall not hurt you--the fiends!","ACD"
id2712,"Just while I’m looking round.","ACR"
id6816,"Frank was praised, as a quiet, gentleman-like, interesting lad—but he was also reported to be rather slow at acquiring the rudiments of engineering science.","WKL"
id5068,"The Captain's brother?","WKL"
id3964,"But, if my memory is not at fault, in the case of a recent murder, the doctor first gave a verdict of heart failure—altering it when the local constable pointed out that there was a bullet wound through the head!","ACR"
id6718,"Mrs. Vanstone, feeling what was due to her long friendship with Miss Garth, had apparently placed the fullest confidence in her, on one subject, by way of unsuspiciously maintaining the strictest reserve toward her on another.","WKL"
id328,"Have you no desire, in view of later research, to modify this statement?","ACD"
id6845,"His beard was still in its infancy; and nascent lines of whisker traced their modest way sparely down his cheeks.","WKL"
id1035,"I suppose it _is_ pretty thick, now that you mention it.","ACD"
id2575,"Why?","ACR"
id4180,"Lawrence, the younger, had been a delicate youth.","ACR"
id356,"You will kindly show the envelope of this letter to my man, Austin, when you call, as he has to take every precaution to shield me from the intrusive rascals who call themselves 'journalists.'","ACD"
id4004,"He had found——  Her voice trailed away.","ACR"
id196,"The news editor smiled grimly.","ACD"
id4401,"Then I dismissed him from my mind, and returned to the contemplation of my own affairs.","ACR"
id3604,"That was Maude’s voice!","ACR"
id3027,"Shortly after one o’clock on January 8th, a well-dressed woman with a slight foreign accent had entered the offices of Messrs. Butler and Park, house-agents, in Knightsbridge.","ACR"
id2065,"It was the best man who should go, and yet it was the best man whom he could least spare.","ACD"
id2221,"I passed the cathedral and followed the street which had been described to me.","ACD"
id5917,"How you look at me!","WKL"
id3373,"My friend Poirot is out, but I know for a fact that he’ll be back very shortly.","ACR"
id3789,"Therefore, _milord_, I have much pleasure in returning you—this!","ACR"
id372,"He seemed to be a person of few words.","ACD"
id4941,"Sarah!","WKL"
id90,"She looked so beautiful in her enthusiasm that I nearly brought down the whole level of the interview.","ACD"
id5533,"you are not to have it all your own way, my good fellow.","WKL"
id2199,"A voice along the roof called Manuelo!","ACD"
id5589,"It will come better, he answered, from a third person, whom I expect here every minute.","WKL"
id5523,"With the exception of myself, and one or two other friends of former days, you have presented your wife to nobody.","WKL"
id237,"That's your man, Mr. Malone.","ACD"
id6147,"The last look of life flickered in the filmy eyes and went out.","WKL"
id189,"You are very good, sir.","ACD"
id4707,"I must make my apologies, said the doctor.","ACR"
id378,"May I ask if you have met my husband before?","ACD"
id1931,"You shall pay me for the wrong which you have done me.","ACD"
id3391,"If Miss Marvell has had warning letters——  Miss Marvell?","ACR"
id86,"When I read his wife's life of him I could so understand her love!","ACD"
id4183,"He had married two years ago, and had taken his wife to live at Styles, though I entertained a shrewd suspicion that he would have preferred his mother to increase his allowance, which would have enabled him to have a home of his own.","ACR"
id5864,"Lady Jane followed him, and tapped him briskly on the shoulder with her parasol.","WKL"
id4357,"With dark eyes and eyelashes she would have been a beauty.","ACR"
id5484,"She looked at Mr. Kendrew, holding the door open for her; and resumed, with an effort, her former lightness of tone.","WKL"
id5288,"Lost in the labyrinth of her own thoughts, she moved slowly past flower-beds, long since rooted up, and along gravel walks overgrown by weeds; her eyes wandering mechanically over the prospect, her feet mechanically carrying her on wherever there was a trace of a footpath, lead where it might.","WKL"
id3927,"We proved to be fortunate in our call.","ACR"
id2037,"asked Captain Pelletan.","ACD"
id2395,"The suspicions aroused during the War have never died down.","ACR"
id5756,"There is a lady at the door, Sir, who wishes to see the house.","WKL"
id5887,"The social experience of the upper classes is, in England, an experience of universal welcome.","WKL"
id4014,"In the hall, I think.","ACR"
id3893,"He had encouraged me to make a perfect fool of myself!","ACR"
id6555,"They crossed the stream, and ascended by the little rocky pass to the hills beyond; then diverged to the left, and returned by a cross-road which led through the village of Combe-Raven.","WKL"
id6056,"Was Lady Jane coming back?","WKL"
id4489,"I thought of the white-haired old lady in the big house, and that vivid wicked little face that had just smiled into ours, and a vague chill of foreboding crept over me.","ACR"
id3633,"As I did so something fluttered to the ground.","ACR"
id1847,"she cried.","ACD"
id6786,"When this proposal was received, Mr. Clare, as usual, first shifted his own character as Frank’s father on Mr. Vanstone’s shoulders—and then moderated his neighbor’s parental enthusiasm from the point of view of an impartial spectator.","WKL"
id1797,"He will never forgive you.","ACD"
id5823,"I presume I am addressing the owner of the house?","WKL"
id4091,"But some news I got made me alter my plans, as I dare say you heard me explain to Mrs. Maltravers.","ACR"
id991,"In your       opinion there is a diabolical agency which makes Dartmoor an       unsafe abode for a Baskerville—that is your opinion?","ACD"
id1551,"I waited for a minute or so and then I ventured to take a stealthy peep from between my lashes.","ACD"
id525,"A policeman was beside us, his notebook in his hand.","ACD"
id4829,"A bell rang in the passage outside.","WKL"
id276,"Yes, I expect that's what old Wadley said.","ACD"
id2752,"I noticed when I went down that Mrs. Flemming’s eyes rested on my exposed ears with quite a kindly glance.","ACR"
id158,"So was the Southwark fire.","ACD"
id2044,"Your request is unusual, said Major Olivier, but it will be granted.","ACD"
id164,"What is it?","ACD"
id2174,"But suddenly my ears caught the patter of feet, and I cowered against the trunk and tried to blend myself with its shadow.","ACD"
id5114,"Sarah looked up, and saw signs of convulsion beginning to disfigure the white face--saw the fingers of the white, delicate hand getting crooked as they reached over toward the table on which the medicine-bottles were placed.","WKL"
id5959,"She looked at her husband, with the torn curtain clenched fast in her hand.","WKL"
id6202,"Getting on well at the Bar, Mr. Delamayn got on better still in Parliament.","WKL"
id4611,"As a detective, his _flair_ had been extraordinary, and he had achieved triumphs by unravelling some of the most baffling cases of the day.","ACR"
id1585,"Again I kicked and fought my way through them, though one of them tore a handful of hair from my head in his effort to hold me.","ACD"
id3810,"_Mais oui!_ The warning letters, the Chinaman, the article in _Society Gossip_, all sprang from the ingenious brain of Mr. Rolf!","ACR"
id6019,"After a moment’s hesitation Lady Jane looked round at Mrs. Vanborough, standing silent at her side--looked, and started back in terror.","WKL"
id6455,"Nothing more was said.","WKL"
id1964,"I will tell it to you exactly as it occurred.","ACD"
id1152,"What do you make of it, Dr. Mortimer?","ACD"
id4075,"You notice that I emphasized the point that we were returning to London by the first train?","ACR"
id3309,"She hesitated a moment, and then added abruptly: Do either of you ever see _Society Gossip_?","ACR"
id5639,"What have we got to do with that now?","WKL"
id1193,"But       a _Times_ leader is entirely distinctive, and these words could       have been taken from nothing else.","ACD"
id1768,"All is not lost.","ACD"
id5223,"Just as Sarah turned away from it she looked toward the inner end of the passage.","WKL"
id4818,"She HAS lasted the night out.","WKL"
id703,"asked Holmes with some asperity.","ACD"
id2909,"The particulars of several were given to her, including those of the Mill House.","ACR"
id1726,"The prisoner has no defence, said one of my masked judges.","ACD"
id1234,"You have not observed anyone follow or watch you?","ACD"
id1693,"Stand aside, brother, said the old man who presided.","ACD"

id1574,"I dodged back and tried the door through which I had been brought, but it was fastened with great bars and I could not loosen them.","ACD"
id2293,"I implore you, I entreat you, to put an end to my sufferings.","ACD"
id5316,"I shall do neither--my purpose is to      conceal it in the place, of all others, where I think there      is least chance of its ever being found again.","WKL"
id1729,"There is one matter, your Excellency, said another.","ACD"
id2814,"At this moment the man turned as though to retrace his steps along the platform.","ACR"
id3294,"At Yardly Chase?","ACR"
id4204,"But you could have knocked us all down with a feather when, three months ago, she suddenly announced that she and Alfred were engaged!","ACR"

id4450,"Look after her, Mr. Hastings.","ACR"
id311,"This shall be my link with the terrible Professor.","ACD"
id2305,"Then the eyes of the man with the lantern fell upon the flagon of wine upon the table.","ACD"
id353,"You quote an isolated sentence from my lecture, and appear to have some difficulty in understanding it.","ACD"
id3171,"I thought.","ACR"
id5638,"Mr. Vanborough’s temper began to show itself again.","WKL"
id1303,"I’d prefer to walk, for this affair has flurried me rather.","ACD"
id3000,"I’ve worked in Hospital during the war, and I’ve seen doctors handle bodies.","ACR"
id1793,"Lorenzo is there.","ACD"
id3485,"•   •   •   •   •   •   •   Lord Yardly turned out to be a cheery, loud-voiced sportsman with a rather red face, but with a good-humoured bonhomie about him that was distinctly attractive and made up for any lack of mentality.","ACR"
id34,"I don't know, Gladys.","ACD"
id2193,"However, all was silent save for the chimes striking midnight in the city.","ACD"
id1269,"Thus encouraged, our scientific friend drew his papers from his       pocket and presented the whole case as he had done upon the       morning before.","ACD"

id3328,"You have no superstitious terrors?","ACR"
id6842,"He had gone away a backward lad of seventeen; he returned a young man of twenty.","WKL"
id3748,"He must have watched you out of the hotel, sir, and nipped in as soon as you were well away.","ACR"
id2844,"I hoped it was nothing important that he had lost, and for the first time I examined it.","ACR"
id2245,"There was a groaning, but no reply.","ACD"
id1170,"Dr. Mortimer looked at Holmes with an air of professional       interest, and Sir Henry Baskerville turned a pair of puzzled dark       eyes upon me.","ACD"
id3534,"All right, but I don’t see——  _Ca n’a pas d’importance_, said Poirot kindly.","ACR"
id4488,"The one that Miss Howard——  Exactly, said John, with rather unnecessary abruptness.","ACR"
id4940,"But I should have spoken in spite of that, if he had not talked of the child.","WKL"
id5724,"Am I really to understand that you hesitate to set this dreadful mistake right, and to make the woman who is your wife in the sight of Heaven your wife in the sight of the law?","WKL"
id2170,"A half moon was shining brightly, and the line of roof stood out dark and hard against the purple, starry sky.","ACD"
id6199,"Five years more passed, dating from the day when the deserted wife was laid in her grave.","WKL"
id6429,"When he came to the fifth his attention, which had hitherto wandered toward Magdalen, suddenly became fixed on the post-mark of the letter.","WKL"
id3638,"Come, hurry.","ACR"
id2841,"I stopped, picked it up, and ran after him.","ACR"
id1675,"I was not any nearer to escape than I had been before, for there was no other wooden wall which I could penetrate and the spring lock of the door had been closed.","ACD"
id3463,"_Voila_, that does not tell us much.","ACR"
id5774,"Let her in.","WKL"
id4929,"Let no one in, till I give you leave.","WKL"

id2111,"That is the enemy's present line of defence, said he.","ACD"
id6336,"The whole countenance—so remarkable in its strongly opposed characteristics—was rendered additionally striking by its extraordinary mobility.","WKL"
id5790,"He muttered between his teeth, What am I to do?","WKL"

id5846,"I ought to see by the sun that the aspect is south.","WKL"
id6708,"For the first few minutes, a natural sympathy for Mrs. Vanstone was the only feeling of which Miss Garth was conscious after she had laid the letter down.","WKL"
id3984,"About ten minutes elapsed, and then the door opened, and a slender figure in widow’s weeds stood upon the threshold.","ACR"
id5831,"In Mr. Vanborough’s situation what reply was possible?","WKL"

id2310,"I heard his feet clattering wildly on the cobble-stones until the sound died away in the distance.","ACD"

id4750,"Oh, the poor mistress!","ACR"
id442,"I am, of course, a mere student, said I, with a fatuous smile, hardly more, I might say, than an earnest inquirer.","ACD"
id165,"Do you think, Sir, that you could possibly send me on some mission for the paper?","ACD"
id6331,"But it was here exactly that the promise of her face failed of performance in the most startling manner.","WKL"
id5437,"The only hardship that I complain of is the hardship of having the house to let.","WKL"
id3232,"He drew out the enclosure.","ACR"
id2020,"But my rage had dried my tears.","ACD"
id3207,"A bell rang below.","ACR"
id2646,"Thinking it over now, I believe I did the little man an injustice.","ACR"

id5849,"Of course it’s quiet!","WKL"
id4314,"Well, I’ve always had a secret hankering to be a detective!","ACR"
id4663,"Of course not.","ACR"
id2726,"It had originally been what I call a Mary hat, meaning by that the kind of hat a housemaid ought to wear on her day out—but doesn’t!","ACR"
id2881,"But what could have alarmed him?","ACR"
id3877,"Oh, la la, _never_ does a woman destroy a letter if she can avoid it!","ACR"
id6802,"said Mr. Vanstone.","WKL"
id5477,"I wish I could smooth out that frown!","WKL"
id4738,"I’ll come at once.","ACR"

id6792,"pooh!","WKL"
id4286,"It struck me that he might look natural on a stage, but was strangely out of place in real life.","ACR"
id4532,"She did not return with us, having been asked to a supper party, and to remain the night with some friends who had been acting with her in the tableaux.","ACR"
id1852,"I will make no sound.","ACD"
id2767,"I fished about until I found some old lip-salve, and I put oceans of it on my lips.","ACR"
id1222,"But       you know the hotel ink and the hotel pen, where it is rare to get       anything else.","ACD"
id5451,"Nobody believes in our gravel soil and our south aspect.","WKL"
id4792,"Her face was heavily flushed, and she yawned repeatedly.","ACR"
id3291,"I’ll let you into a little secret, Monsieur Poirot, Miss Marvell was continuing.","ACR"
id4779,"Turning to Annie, one of the housemaids, he sent her downstairs to the dining-room for brandy.","ACR"
id2504,"And I am not alone in this.","ACR"
id4526,"He seemed very excited and restless.","ACR"
id6657,"Or a second mystery, following close on the heels of the mysterious journey to London?","WKL"
id3692,"I began to suspect that, having made a mistake to start with, he was singularly loath to proceed with the case.","ACR"
id2968,"I tried another tack.","ACR"
id1036,"Thick!","ACD"
id6673,"None whatever.","WKL"
id5465,"she said.","WKL"
id6823,"Two years had then passed since Frank’s departure.","WKL"
id6520,"I don’t like change.","WKL"
id2356,"The door was shut, and two fierce-looking fellows stood on guard outside it, one of them with a key stuck in his belt.","ACD"
id5204,"After reflecting a little, she lighted one of the chamber-candles standing on the hall-table, at the lamp in the study, and ascended the stairs again to her master's bedroom.","WKL"
id4923,"Their master, after he had passed the prime of life, had, in very truth, taken his wife from the obscure stage of a country theatre, when little more than two years had elapsed since her first appearance in public.","WKL"
id1011,"Three people did.","ACD"
id5975,"No!","WKL"
id3392,"She has been here?","ACR"
id4752,"John opened the door of his room.","ACR"
id5613,"Externally speaking, the rising solicitor, who was going to try his luck at the Bar, looked like a man who was going to succeed.","WKL"
id903,"Had Sir Charles reached this?","ACD"
id5328,"She recoiled from it at first, and took a few steps back toward the staircase.","WKL"
id6769,"The bond of intercourse thus curiously established between them was strengthened on Mr. Vanstone’s side by a hearty interest in his neighbor’s three sons—an interest by which those sons benefited all the more importantly, seeing that one of the prejudices which their father had outlived was a prejudice in favor of his own children.","WKL"
id3384,"There was no doubt as to my bolt having shot home.","ACR"
id4335,"Of course I should.","ACR"
id6179,"He appeared as Junior in a famous case, in which the honor of a great family, and the title to a great estate were concerned.","WKL"
id4518,"What she saw in the man I cannot imagine, but she was always asking him up to the house, and often went off for long expeditions with him.","ACR"
id5266,"she said.","WKL"
id1437,"It must be confessed, however, that some of our men behaved very badly in this matter of the statues and the pictures.","ACD"
id1063,"He unrolled one section and held it over his knee.","ACD"
id2800,"I was foolishly pleased to find I was right.","ACR"
id4713,"The sun soon dried me off, he added, but I’m afraid my appearance is very disreputable.","ACR"
id1357,"I should then at my leisure have hired a       second cab and followed the first at a respectful distance, or,       better still, have driven to the Northumberland Hotel and waited       there.","ACD"
id5425,"The younger one went on.","WKL"
id2524,"He really was a genius—every one admits that.","ACR"
id2551,"There were times when I envied Emily, our little servant, who walked out whenever occasion offered with a large sailor to whom she was affianced.","ACR"
id5808,"he exclaimed.","WKL"
id2517,"I was mixed up in the affair from the very beginning, I was in the thick of it all through, and I was triumphantly in at the death.","ACR"
id5375,"She was still a rarely beautiful woman.","WKL"
id4524,"We had a late luncheon and spent the afternoon resting in the garden.","ACR"
id1943,"I could sympathise with the struggle which I could see in the Italian's face.","ACD"
id3546,"She comes to you on Friday, does she not?","ACR"
id6819,"These reports, and many others which resembled them, were all conscientiously presented by Frank’s friend to the attention of Frank’s father.","WKL"
id6432,"she said.","WKL"
id5471,"Yes--business.","WKL"
id6507,"The servants, little used in that family to sudden resolutions and unexpected orders, were awkward and confused in obeying directions.","WKL"
id6553,"Toward the afternoon the weather improved.","WKL"
id2053,"Olivier's face was no longer mocking, but it was dark and stern.","ACD"
id624,"Now, you will observe that he could not have been on the _staff_       of the hospital, since only a man well-established in a London       practice could hold such a position, and such a one would not       drift into the country.","ACD"
id2420,"And an apostle of the maxim, ‘If you want a thing done safely, do not do it yourself!’ Here are we, every one of us incriminated up to the hilt and absolutely in his power, and not one of us has anything on him.","ACR"
id3539,"A pretty picture met our eyes: Lady Yardly and her two children, the mother’s proud dark head bent down over the two fair ones.","ACR"
id566,"I believe you have eyes in       the back of your head.","ACD"
id6578,"His manners were distinguished by a grave serenity.","WKL"
id1813,"I will not tell you, Etienne, for it would hurt you far more than it would me.","ACD"
id5426,"The elder stopped, and looked at her mother.","WKL"
id6418,"One for me.","WKL"
id4979,"Come back and prop me up higher on the pillows.","WKL"
id4894,"His countenance was kind, hearty, and open; and the tears were still trickling down it which he had shed by his wife's bedside.","WKL"
id6417,"None for mamma.","WKL"
id3058,"Was it a coincidence?","ACR"
id284,"He's as clever as they make 'em--a full-charged battery of force and vitality, but a quarrelsome, ill-conditioned faddist, and unscrupulous at that.","ACD"
id3562,"In a short time they were all romping together, and had dragged me into the game.","ACR"
id6345,"Magdalen!","WKL"
id2051,"They were impressed by my cold and practical manner.","ACD"
id229,"Went to South America on a solitary expedeetion two years ago.","ACD"
id4139,"The young soldier looked at him curiously and wiped his brow as he got up.","ACR"
id2855,"I explained to Mrs. Flemming that I had witnessed a nasty accident in the Tube and that I was rather upset and would go to my room and lie down.","ACR"
id1586,"The little steward struck me with a key and I was battered and bruised, but once more I cleared a way in front of me.","ACD"
id2233,"Perhaps he was only a lodger in a Spanish family, and my visit might bring ruin to him as well as to myself.","ACD"
id2636,"Our tiny local library suddenly made up its mind to have an assistant librarian.","ACR"
id6825,"Two days after Mr. Vanstone’s return from London, he was called away from the breakfast-table before he had found time enough to look over his letters, delivered by the morning’s post.","WKL"
id6156,"Report, which sees the inmost hearts of men, and delights in turning them outward to the public view, had always declared that Mr. Kendrew’s life had its secret, and that the secret was a hopeless passion for the beautiful woman who had married his friend.","WKL"
id860,"I checked and corroborated all the       facts which were mentioned at the inquest.","ACD"
id3308,"Gregory knew her when she was out West three years ago, said Miss Marvell.","ACR"
id1014,"Thank you.","ACD"
id31,"But--oh, Ned, our friendship has been so good and so pleasant!","ACD"
id3229,"The latter scrutinized them closely.","ACR"
id2361,"Nadina, the Russian dancer who had taken Paris by storm, swayed to the sound of the applause, bowed and bowed again.","ACR"
id1240,"I think anything out of the ordinary routine of life well worth       reporting.","ACD"
id6878,"No, no, said Mr. Vanstone, detaining him.","WKL"
id2230,"Then I stood still and wondered what I should do next, and how I could gain some news of this Hubert, in whose house I found myself.","ACD"
id2762,"I’d much prefer to have Irish blue eyes than dark green ones with yellow flecks!","ACR"
id409,"I am sure that his top-hat, had I ever ventured to don it, would have slipped over me entirely and rested on my shoulders.","ACD"
id5461,"I wasn’t listening.","WKL"
id5561,"I saw you with her last night in her box; and I heard what was said in the stalls near me.","WKL"
id1926,"My heart was heavy for him at the time, but after all it is every man for himself in love, and if one fails in the game it is some consolation to lose to one who can be a graceful and considerate winner.","ACD"
id4798,"A fresh access of pain seized the unfortunate old lady.","ACR"
id65,"She looked at me with a wondering distrust which was much more to my mind than her whole-hearted confidence.","ACD"
id671,"said Holmes, shaking his head.","ACD"
id2074,"By convenience because I shall not be missed in the regiments since the men have not yet learned to know me.","ACD"
id5001,"she cried, catching at her mistress's hand--but suddenly letting it go again the moment Mrs. Treverton looked at her.","WKL"
id2869,"He seemed to fear that it would be a great ordeal to me, and I had to conceal from him my complete composure.","ACR"
id6430,"Stooping over him, with her head on his shoulder, Magdalen could see the post-mark as plainly as her father saw it—NEW ORLEANS.","WKL"
id4847,"Go up and tell her that she is wanted by her mistress.","WKL"
id5732,"I am ashamed of having ever been your friend.","WKL"
id1821,"You must not care, Etienne.","ACD"
id4641,"Mrs. Cavendish was coming down the stairs.","ACR"
id2639,"The doctor was nearer forty than thirty, and a round, tubby little man.","ACR"
id5800,"Thus far she had addressed Mr. Delamayn, who happened to be nearest to her.","WKL"
id126,"I cried.","ACD"
id4470,"As the motor drove away, Mrs. Cavendish suddenly detached herself from the group, and moved across the drive to the lawn to meet a tall bearded man who had been evidently making for the house.","ACR"
id1582,"As I flung open the door, ready to bound out into the street, the light of the hall shone upon the deep, still, black water which lay flush with the topmost step.","ACD"
id3411,"Unfortunately I destroyed them.","ACR"
id5030,"Write!","WKL"
id3714,"That ‘full of the moon’ idea was clever.","ACR"
id4861,"This was the story that was told in Sarah Leeson's face--this, and no more.","WKL"
id1549,"His heart beats like a hammer.","ACD"
id2035,"I feel, however, that I have some claim upon these other gentlemen who laughed at my expense.","ACD"
id5795,"A light summer veil hung over her face.","WKL"
id1851,"It is nothing.","ACD"
id3835,"And then comes the menace of the possible sale of the diamond.","ACR"
id5537,"It didn’t matter, abroad.","WKL"
id2377,"The maize _peignoir,_ Jeanne, and quickly.","ACR"
id3167,"So all is explained!","ACR"
id1379,"He stood now gazing with great reverence       at the famous detective.","ACD"
id2590,"Your point of view always depresses me, my child.","ACR"
id5840,"Mastering in a moment his first natural astonishment at the liberty taken with him, Mr. Delamayn drew the inevitable conclusion that there was something wrong, and that there was an attempt (not to be permitted for a moment) to mix him up in it.","WKL"
id1246,"You will       find it when you return to the hotel.","ACD"
id4165,"As a boy, though, I had often stayed at Styles, his mother’s place in Essex.","ACR"
id6824,"In one year more results asserted themselves, and settled the question.","WKL"
id805,"Sir Charles Baskerville             was in the habit every night before going to bed of walking             down the famous yew alley of Baskerville Hall.","ACD"
id1102,"There lies our problem.","ACD"
id6363,"I’m ready for another concert to-night, and a ball to-morrow, and a play the day after.","WKL"
id5213,"The door of what had been Mrs. Treverton's bedroom was opened, when she ventured to knock at it, by the nurse, who inquired, roughly and suspiciously, what she wanted there.","WKL"
id5922,"The lady of the house was a lady in an anomalous position of some kind.","WKL"
id1431,"But the highest soldier is a man like myself who can understand the things of the mind and the soul.","ACD"
id3334,"What more Poirot would have said I do not know, for at that moment the door flew open, and a splendid-looking man strode into the room.","ACR"
id1673,"At once I renewed my work upon the planks, and within a very few minutes I had loosened them in such a way that I could remove and replace them at pleasure.","ACD"
id3340,"They made a ridiculous contrast.","ACR"
id4108,"Shall we begin?","ACR"
id5725,"If you choose to put it in that light, said Mr. Vanborough; if you won’t consider--  I want a plain answer to my question--‘yes, or no.’  Let me speak, will you!","WKL"
id2086,"The colonel hurried onward until at last, after a long walk, we found our way barred by a high grey wall which stretched right across our path.","ACD"
id6415,"Two for Norah, she announced, beginning with her sister.","WKL"
id1830,"I knew that it was not so, but how could I bring myself to tell her?","ACD"
id896,"Yes, there is a strip of grass about six feet broad on either       side.","ACD"
id1898,"Curse it, I wish I had to do with a man instead of a woman, and the fairest woman in Venice, said the gondolier.","ACD"
id6376,"Mr. Vanstone sat down composedly under his daughter’s flow of language, like a man who was well used to verbal inundation from that quarter.","WKL"
id1905,"One of them had gone for a lamp and Matteo was stooping over me with a handkerchief.","ACD"
id987,"All the good work which       has been done by Sir Charles will crash to the ground if there is       no tenant of the Hall.","ACD"
id4824,"Robert, said the other, you have been in the service here since you were a boy--did you ever hear that our mistress was a play-actress when our master married her?","WKL"
id2464,"With these diamonds in my possession, I have the whip-hand of my esteemed chief.","ACR"
id4124,"Country.","ACR"
id2972,"In fact, inspector, you are determined to find nothing odd, I said sweetly.","ACR"
id176,"The big blank spaces in the map are all being filled in, and there's no room for romance anywhere.","ACD"
id1182,"Really, Mr. Holmes, this exceeds anything which I could have       imagined, said Dr. Mortimer, gazing at my friend in amazement.","ACD"
id1705,"I am.","ACD"
id1791,"They have simply returned me to my cell.","ACD"
id4981,"Come back!","WKL"
id6683,"In plain terms, he was an incorrigible scoundrel; and he had now added one more to the list of his many misdemeanors by impudently breaking the conditions on which Mrs. Vanstone had hitherto assisted him.","WKL"
id3147,"What is, _mon ami_?","ACR"
id3177,"_Sacre_!","ACR"
id4057,"We hastened up the drive after the retreating figure.","ACR"
id4056,"Quick, _mon ami_, let us follow him.","ACR"
id2584,"Yes, a little army will be starting soon.","ACR"
id6155,"How he felt the death of the deserted wife is still left to tell.","WKL"
id6906,"repeated Mr. Vanstone—a mad girl, I think you must mean.","WKL"
id2629,"And it hurt me that Papa should have died just when the interest of life was at its height for him.","ACR"
id1486,"And yet upon that night I was as careless as a foolish young recruit who fears lest he should be thought to be afraid.","ACD"
id579,"Perfectly sound!","ACD"
id2954,"The man who had an order to view this same house at Marlow in his pocket.","ACR"
id6582,"he began, with a circular wave of his hand in the direction of the house.","WKL"
id2192,"For some minutes I did not dare to move, for it seemed certain that someone would be attracted by the noise.","ACD"
id1382,"Now,       Cartwright, there are the names of twenty-three hotels here, all       in the immediate neighbourhood of Charing Cross.","ACD"
id1596,"Never shall I forget the sudden flash of hope which shone in his dark eyes when he saw a comrade burst into the room, or the look of despair which followed as he understood that I had come not to change his fate but to share it.","ACD"
id2398,"Our chief lays his plans too carefully for that.","ACR"
id6292,"Although she was now in her forty-fourth year; although she had been tried, in bygone times, by the premature loss of more than one of her children, and by long attacks of illness which had followed those bereavements of former years—she still preserved the fair proportion and subtle delicacy of feature, once associated with the all-adorning brightness and freshness of beauty, which had left her never to return.","WKL"
id5192,"Do you come to me already?","WKL"
id1349,"Exactly.","ACD"
id1427,"The folk there live like water-rats upon a mud-bank, but the houses are very fine, and the churches, especially that of St. Mark, are as great as any I have seen.","ACD"
id2382,"In feature, little to take hold of, a man difficult to recognize again if one left his mannerisms out of account.","ACR"
id773,"Such is the tale, my sons, of the coming of the hound             which is said to have plagued the family so sorely ever             since.","ACD"
id528,"It was the most rational remark which I had heard in Enmore Park.","ACD"
id3245,"No; they were left by hand—by a _Chinaman._ That is what frightens me.","ACR"
id2833,"Now then, stand back there, will you?","ACR"
id3879,"It’s all very well, I said, my anger rising, but you’ve made a perfect fool of me!","ACR"
id2592,"No, no, in the cause of science one must not be sordid.","ACR"
id4646,"Where is Mrs. Inglethorp?","ACR"
id2708,"London!","ACR"
id2123,"The question is, what has become of him?","ACD"

id5942,"The sense of her injury (if this was true), the pang of her jealousy (if that woman was his wife), stripped the human nature in her bare of all disguises, raised the angry color in her cheeks, and struck the angry fire out of her eyes.","WKL"

id184,"Anything--anywhere--I care nothing.","ACD"
id1430,"There was old Bouvet, for example--the one who was killed by the Prussians on the day that I won the Emperor's medal; if you took him away from the camp and the canteen, and spoke to him of books or of art, he would sit and stare at you.","ACD"

id191,"I dare say I looked a little startled.","ACD"
id5353,"Make your husband bring you back to England.","WKL"
id3522,"It’s been in the family for some generations, but it’s not entailed.","ACR"
id6682,"He had married a poor ignorant woman, who had served as a waitress at some low eating-house, who had unexpectedly come into a little money, and whose small inheritance he had mercilessly squandered to the last farthing.","WKL"
id5475,"Ring, dear, she said, when you want coffee.","WKL"
id3377,"I felt a desire to rise to the occasion.","ACR"
id3704,"And what about the ‘full of the moon’ now?","ACR"
id6002,"Oblige me by coming here for a moment, he said.","WKL"
id3584,"She waited, as though for a reply, but when none came her face hardened.","ACR"
id3761,"To a post office.","ACR"
id5690,"Your marriage with Miss Anne Silvester is no marriage at all.","WKL"
id1594,"It was Captain Auret, of the 7th, a young Basque with whom I had drunk many a glass during the winter.","ACD"
id5757,"The house is not to be seen at this time of the evening.","WKL"
id4507,"Now that security was removed—and the air seemed rife with suspicion.","ACR"
id2249,"I advanced in the direction of the sound, but only to come in contact with the wall.","ACD"
id5624,"Have you brought any news?","WKL"
id5565,"You alarm, you distress, you disappoint me.","WKL"
id2071,"I would point out, sir, said I, that this mission is mine both by right and by convenience.","ACD"
id5302,"Yes.","WKL"
id5036,"She still retained her senses sufficiently to be vaguely conscious of the effect which the medicine was producing on her, and to be desirous of combating its further progress before it succeeded in utterly confusing her ideas.","WKL"
id4360,"It’s ever so much nicer.","ACR"
id1401,"You will then learn in possibly twenty cases out of       the twenty-three that the waste of the day before has been burned       or removed.","ACD"
id2791,"I had the firm conviction that, if I went about looking for adventure, adventure would meet me halfway.","ACR"
id6208,"There was an outcry on the part of the older members of the Bar.","WKL"
id6386,"A symphony, papa, replied Norah.","WKL"
id2136,"You are to reach that house, to see him, and to find out if his plan is still feasible or if we must abandon it.","ACD"
id6777,"At his intercession, and through his influence, Frank, Cecil, and Arthur were received on the foundation of a well-reputed grammar-school.","WKL"
id1666,"Murderers!","ACD"
id1545,"He has only fainted.","ACD"
id4259,"A figure rose from one of the basket chairs, and came a few steps to meet us.","ACR"
id2331,"It was built in a square with a garden in the centre.","ACD"
id4388,"Lady Tadminster, our Member’s wife—she was the late Lord Abbotsbury’s daughter—does the same.","ACR"
id2002,"But I could at least tell them some incidents which would enable them to say it for themselves.","ACD"
id3235,"It ran as follows:  The great diamond which is the left eye of the god must return whence it came.","ACR"
id6887,"Proposing this ingenious stratagem in a confidential whisper, Mr. Vanstone took Frank’s arm and led him round the house by the back way.","WKL"
id4550,"We’ve got all sorts of secret stores in that cupboard.","ACR"
id271,"Wadley sent a message: 'The President of the Zoological Institute presents his compliments to Professor Challenger, and would take it as a personal favor if he would do them the honor to come to their next meeting.'","ACD"
id1892,"Besides, I did but snip off enough to leave the tribunal's mark upon her.","ACD"
id4060,"You, she gasped.","ACR"
id5702,"The clergy in Ireland of other religious denominations have been relieved from this law.","WKL"
id1145,"Someone seems to be very deeply interested in your       movements.","ACD"
id3129,"Doesn’t sound likely to me, said the inspector.","ACR"
id3355,"_la la_, he observed, returning.","ACR"
id6679,"He had been expelled the militia regiment in which he once held a commission.","WKL"
id6641,"His youthful back appeared to the best advantage; his active little legs took him away trippingly in the direction of the village.","WKL"
id827,"I had observed some newspaper comment at the time, but       I was exceedingly preoccupied by that little affair of the       Vatican cameos, and in my anxiety to oblige the Pope I lost touch       with several interesting English cases.","ACD"
id4466,"Above all, Mr. Hastings, watch that devil—her husband!","ACR"
id2740,"Well, Henry, why on earth—— I lost the rest, but the acerbity of the tone was evident.","ACR"
id3861,"She has lost her diamond through no fault of her own.","ACR"
id3994,"She was about twenty-seven or eight, and very fair, with large blue eyes and a pretty pouting mouth.","ACR"
id5947,"do you see her?","WKL"
id3616,"The side door in question was a small one in the angle of the wall, not more than a dozen yards from the scene of the tragedy.","ACR"
id5524,"Your new position has smoothed the way for you into the best society.","WKL"
id3788,"And the ruse succeeded, said Poirot cheerfully.","ACR"
id2520,"Anne Beddingfeld starts to narrate her adventures.","ACR"
id431,"Put me alone, sir, and with my back to the wall.","ACD"
id5632,"What is that?","WKL"
id4555,"The countenances of Cynthia and Nibs were suddenly petrified into a stern and forbidding expression.","ACR"
id6959,"In other words, he threw aside his cigar, and followed her out of the greenhouse.","WKL"
id524,"Then and there we should have tried the thing out, for he was effervescing with fight, but fortunately I was rescued from an odious situation.","ACD"
id555,"The speech had a sinister sound, but I followed him none the less into the house.","ACD"
id829,"It does.","ACD"
id3644,"I was just going to turn on the other light, she said, when a man sprang on me from behind.","ACR"
id3226,"You comprehend, I am still in the dark.","ACR"
id3795,"It makes no matter.","ACR"
id2288,"have you been hanging here for two days?","ACD"
id4376,"How many people do you poison?","ACR"
id5587,"Then, why not tell me frankly what it is?","WKL"
id3341,"Hoax or no hoax, Mr. Rolf, he said dryly, I have advised Madame your wife not to take the jewel with her to Yardly Chase on Friday.","ACR"
id4965,"I want strength.","WKL"

id4898,"Sarah Leeson, instead of entering her mistress's room, stood looking after her master attentively, with her pale cheeks turned to a deathly whiteness--with an eager, doubting, questioning terror in her eyes.","WKL"
id6248,"Yes; Thomas had heard the concert; he had been paid for to go in at the back; it was a loud concert; it was a hot concert; it was described at the top of the bills as Grand; whether it was worth traveling sixteen miles to hear by railway, with the additional hardship of going back nineteen miles by road, at half-past one in the morning—was a question which he would leave his master and the young ladies to decide; his own opinion, in the meantime, being unhesitatingly, No.","WKL"
id5449,"Some wretch of a woman says, ‘Do you think the drains are right?’--and sniffs suspiciously, before I can say Yes.","WKL"
id6162,"He traveled.","WKL"
id6399,"I dare say I have left it in the library, along with my other keys, said Mr. Vanstone.","WKL"
id4914,"The disease of which Mrs. Treverton was dying was one of the most terrible of all the maladies that afflict humanity, one to which women are especially subject, and one which undermines life without, in most cases, showing any remarkable traces of its corroding progress in the face.","WKL"

id5486,"The two gentlemen were left alone over their wine.","WKL"
id5860,"Do you want a reference?","WKL"
id6858,"Was it Frank’s fault if he had not got the stuff in him that engineers were made of?","WKL"
id2964,"And no money.","ACR"
id5383,"The lady of the house looked round at the servant who was waiting, and said, Tell the children to come in.","WKL"
id6614,"Gone to London with Mr. Vanstone.","WKL"
id2319,"As I stood there, breathless, the great brass bells roared twice above my head.","ACD"
id1453,"I can say this with all discretion, that she was of one of the senatorial families of Venice and that her grandfather had been Doge of the town.","ACD"
id2219,"As I had imagined, this broad boulevard led out into the central square, which was full of troops and blazing with fires.","ACD"
id1782,"In answer to your letter.","ACD"
id2404,"That is what the ‘Colonel’ has always been—an excellent man of business.","ACR"
id2127,"Shall we still wait for him, or shall we attempt the attack elsewhere?","ACD"
id5227,"She went in immediately, and saw that the candle-light came from an inner room, usually occupied, as she well knew, by the nursery-maid and by the only child of the house of Treverton--a little girl named Rosamond, aged, at that time, nearly five years.","WKL"
id6187,"Mr. Delamayn noticed that Mr. Vanborough was looking old and worn and gray.","WKL"

id2110,"He led me to the door and pointed to the high grey wall which towered up amongst the debris of the shattered houses.","ACD"
id5958,"She caught at the white curtains of the window to save herself from falling, and tore them.","WKL"
id3069,"Will you take a seat?","ACR"
id2527,"Unfortunately one cannot entirely dispense with modern men.","ACR"
id6857,"Mr. Vanstone was too easy-tempered and sanguine—and too anxious, as well, not to yield his old antagonist an inch more ground than he could help—to look at the letter from any such unfavorable point of view.","WKL"
id4307,"No secret hobby?","ACR"
id1784,"The cunning demons!","ACD"
id6561,"Whether the man was really following them, or not, made little difference, for they were now close to the house.","WKL"
id2346,"In the garden was a well, and beside the well were a number of empty buckets.","ACD"
id6476,"Not one in a hundred of you knows which end of her’s uppermost.","WKL"
id5663,"You got over her objection by consenting to become a Roman Catholic, like herself?","WKL"
id5092,"She stopped again, smiled a little, whispered to herself rapidly, Wait, wait, wait!","WKL"
id5901,"She looked at the lawyer.","WKL"
id453,"Undoubtedly.","ACD"
id569,"Since we have been so unfortunate as to miss       him and have no notion of his errand, this accidental souvenir       becomes of importance.","ACD"
id4382,"Certainly, Aunt Emily.","ACR"

id6349,"Magdalen!","WKL"

id5994,"I provided myself with the paper in your hand.","WKL"
id2967,"Some men don’t carry a pocket-book or notecase of any kind.","ACR"
id3848,"I objected.","ACR"
id5424,"The girls were peeling fruit.","WKL"
id3421,"Of course!","ACR"
id2650,"But it’s impossible.","ACR"
id939,"I could not call you in, Mr. Holmes, without disclosing these       facts to the world, and I have already given my reasons for not       wishing to do so.","ACD"
id6316,"A very little headache; not half enough to make me regret the concert, she said, and walked away by herself to the window.","WKL"

id338,"Once I am in his room I may see some opening.","ACD"
id61,"She nodded severely.","ACD"
id5916,"Mrs. Vanborough’s indignation was suspended for the moment in dread, as she saw the passion and the terror struggling in her husband’s face.","WKL"

id2530,"Frankly, I hate Palaeolithic Man, be he Aurignacian, Mousterian, Chellian, or anything else, and though I typed and revised most of Papa’s _Neanderthal Man and his Ancestors,_ Neanderthal men themselves fill me with loathing, and I always reflect what a fortunate circumstance it was that they became extinct in remote ages.","ACR"

id5165,"The oath which had been proposed by Mrs. Treverton under no more serious influence than the last caprice of her disordered faculties, stimulated by confused remembrances of stage words and stage situations, had been accepted by Sarah Leeson as the most sacred and inviolable engagement to which she could bind herself.","WKL"
id1006,"I will do so, Mr. Holmes.","ACD"
id865,"He said that there were no traces upon the ground round       the body.","ACD"
id2040,"Then they drew off to the other end of the room, and I heard the buzz of their whispers.","ACD"
id4864,"But whatever the nature of the affliction she had suffered, the traces it had left were deeply and strikingly visible in every part of her face.","WKL"
id1730,"It can scarce be referred to without reopening a brother's wounds, but I would remind you that there is a very particular reason why an exemplary punishment should be inflicted in the case of this officer.","ACD"

id5595,"Do you know him?","WKL"
id3910,"In any case, my friend Alfred Wright, who is a director of the Northern Union, has asked me to investigate the facts of the case, but, as I told him, I am not very hopeful of success.","ACR"
id1983,"Even in that one evening I saw several things which shocked me, for I had a high standard, and it went to my heart to see an ill-arranged camp, an ill-groomed horse, or a slovenly trooper.","ACD"
id6040,"Even Mr. Delamayn still mechanically thought of him as the husband--in the face of the law!","WKL"
id4617,"And, for the rest of the way home, I recited to them the various exploits and triumphs of Hercule Poirot.","ACR"
id6364,"Oh, cried Magdalen, dropping into a chair and crossing her hands rapturously on the table, how I do like pleasure!","WKL"
id4709,"Well, Bauerstein, you are in a plight, said John, strolling in from the hall.","ACR"
id464,"Pray do.","ACD"
id5171,"While reiterating these sentences, she vacantly occupied herself in putting things about the room in order, which were set in perfect order already.","WKL"

id2890,"It was most irregular not to do so.","ACR"
id5667,"Abroad or at home?","WKL"
id4931,"repeated Sarah, faintly.","WKL"
id5671,"Referring perpetually to the paper in his hand, Mr. Delamayn was especially careful in comparing that last answer with the answer given to the head-clerk.","WKL"
id6904,"Say Yes, and I’ll be a good girl for the rest of my life.","WKL"

id2860,"When I had finished I had got what I wanted.","ACR"

id816,"One Murphy, a gipsy             horse-dealer, was on the moor at no great distance at the             time, but he appears by his own confession to have been the             worse for drink.","ACD"
id6590,"said Miss Garth, interrupting the stranger’s flow of language, which, all things considered, was beginning, in her opinion, to flow rather freely.","WKL"
id3014,"He could alter his appearance easy enough in five minutes if he wanted to—which he would do if he’s the swell pickpocket you suggest.","ACR"
id4010,"I had walked down to the village for some stamps, and I believe he was out pottering round the grounds.","ACR"
id782,"said he.","ACD"
id3349,"Poirot shrugged his shoulders.","ACR"

id4252,"Out.","ACR"
id1413,"I cannot imagine how the people who laid it out thought that the cavalry could manoeuvre.","ACD"

id4574,"Lawrence remained behind, but after a few moments Cynthia called to him over her shoulder to come and join us.","ACR"
id1445,"Many officers and men disappeared during that winter, and even their bodies were never found.","ACD"

id5304,"No.","WKL"

id1743,"It is, indeed, more than can be asked of flesh and blood that he should remain under this roof.","ACD"
id2829,"Finally, the doctor stood upright and shook his head.","ACR"
id6439,"After a minute or more of hesitation Mr. Vanstone opened the letter.","WKL"
id4821,"The speakers were two of the men-servants composing the establishment of Captain Treverton, an officer in the navy, and the eldest male representative of an old Cornish family.","WKL"
id4592,"Poirot!","ACR"

id1997,"Here I found myself not only unknown, but even disliked.","ACD"
id1572,"They were almost within touch of me and there was no time for thought.","ACD"
id4863,"It was hard to say, at the outset, whether the past pain that had set its ineffaceable mark on her had been pain of the body or pain of the mind.","WKL"
id1417,"The fellow was a good swordsman, and it was fortunate for the credit of French arms that it was I who was opposed to him.","ACD"
id17,"Gladys was full of every womanly quality.","ACD"
id6565,"He took off his hat to Miss Garth politely, as she turned round.","WKL"
id5163,"As a condemned prisoner might read his death-warrant, so did Sarah Leeson now read the few lines which she and her mistress had written together not half an hour since.","WKL"
id3414,"It seems too incredible.","ACR"
id4152,"I proceed to ‘Rook Rifle’ and he answered with the totally unexpected word ‘Farm.’ When I say ‘Shot,’ he answers at once ‘Suicide.’ The association seems clear.","ACR"
id1422,"We were great travellers in those days.","ACD"
id252,"It was just after eleven, and the big room was fairly full, though the rush had not yet set in.","ACD"
id1217,"Now, you would call it a guess, no doubt,       but I am almost certain that this address has been written in a       hotel.","ACD"
id4072,"The missing stick not having been discovered (which was not surprising), Poirot uttered more apologies and we withdrew.","ACR"
id2342,"I had understood from Hubert that the Mother Superior's room, in which the powder was stored, was near to this, and that the train had been laid through a hole in the wall from some neighbouring cell.","ACD"

id490,"He was slowly advancing in a peculiarly menacing way, but he stopped now and put his big hands into the side-pockets of a rather boyish short jacket which he wore.","ACD"
id2316,"I had seen ten thousand men in every conceivable degree of mutilation stretched upon the ground, but the sight had never affected me like those two silent figures who were my companions in that shadowy room.","ACD"
id3627,"Through this door.","ACR"
id5869,"There was a tone of sarcasm in that allusion to the parasol, which might develop into a tone of jealousy at a moment’s notice.","WKL"
id3430,"In spite of his idiosyncrasies, I was deeply attached to my quaint little friend.","ACR"
id4018,"The servant shall take you, she murmured, averting her head.","ACR"
id1966,"You must know, then, that it was in the Second Hussars--called the Hussars of Chamberan--that I had served as a lieutenant and as a junior captain.","ACD"
id2871,"Nothing had been found in his pockets except a house-agent’s order to view a house on the river near Marlow.","ACR"
id2921,"Mrs. James did not see the lady, but thought that she had gone on ahead.","ACR"
id6282,"_You’re_ upset, Thomas, I can see your eyes are as red as a ferret’s, and your cravat looks as if you had slept in it.","WKL"

id1626,"The tribunal will uphold you.","ACD"
id5891,"Mr. Vanborough looks as if he wished me a hundred miles away.","WKL"
id857,"Mr. Stapleton, a mutual friend who was much concerned at       his state of health, was of the same opinion.","ACD"
id6388,"added Magdalen.","WKL"
id5878,"she said, submitting resignedly to the formalities of the middle classes.","WKL"
id5297,"She paused--then fell to smoothing the letter again, and began to recall the terms of the solemn engagement which Mrs. Treverton had forced her to contract.","WKL"
id1913,"It was like the mention of some saint which, by its very sound, can frighten the demons.","ACD"
id4423,"Probably water off a duck’s back, though.","ACR"
id429,"He glared at me as the present representative of the beast.","ACD"
id2220,"I walked swiftly onward, disregarding one or two people who addressed remarks to me.","ACD"
id433,"Well, sir, let us do what we can to curtail this visit, which can hardly be agreeable to you, and is inexpressibly irksome to me.","ACD"
id4640,"I suggested a quick game of tennis before supper and, Cynthia agreeing, I ran upstairs to fetch my racquet.","ACR"
id5199,"she said.","WKL"
id6903,"Say Yes, she pleaded, nestling softly up to her father, and pressing her lips with a fond gentleness to his ear, as she whispered the next words.","WKL"
id6744,"After a few minutes, the figure of a gentleman became visible, at the point where the shrubbery path joined the winding garden-walk which led to the house.","WKL"
id5773,"Very well.","WKL"
id2255,"Here!","ACD"
id2867,"The inquest was held.","ACR"
id2689,"He continued:  I do not suppose you understand much of these matters.","ACR"
id3915,"Five minutes to pack your bag, Hastings, and we will take a taxi to Liverpool Street.","ACR"
id3826,"He made love to Lady Yardly, and then he blackmailed her.","ACR"
id6516,"I have lived twelve years at Combe-Raven; and these are the first family affairs which have got between the parents and the children, in all my experience.","WKL"
id3435,"Ah, here we are!","ACR"
id5607,"Without knowing why, I dislike Mr. Delamayn.","WKL"
id4104,"said Black, with visible alarm.","ACR"
id6642,"One, two, three—and he reached the turn in the road.","WKL"
id1945,"Colonel Gerard, he said, you are worthy of a great love.","ACD"
id2738,"She took me up to a spotless chintz-hung bedroom, hoped I had everything I wanted, informed me that tea would be ready in about a quarter of an hour, and left me to my own devices.","ACR"
id1765,"There was a sharp exclamation of surprise.","ACD"
id2827,"As he examined it, a curious sense of unreality seemed to possess me.","ACR"
id651,"There was such a ring of conviction in his       voice that I glanced up in surprise.","ACD"
id2917,"He was clean-shaven and was wearing a brown suit.","ACR"
id5727,"Mr. Kendrew stopped him by a gesture of disgust.","WKL"
id5478,"she whispered.","WKL"
id5802,"She started, with a loud exclamation of astonishment.","WKL"
id2615,"One gets so dirty there.","ACR"
id1944,"At last he held out his hand to me.","ACD"
id6541,"In the meantime, Norah, my dear, you will find your work and your books, as usual, in the library.","WKL"
id2260,"Then I took a tinder-box from my pocket and struck a light.","ACD"
id4351,"uniform ran lightly across the lawn.","ACR"
id3285,"Well, you see, it’s this way, Monsieur Poirot.","ACR"
id4061,"I thought you were on the sea—on your way to East Africa?","ACR"
id2105,"If I died that night my name would not be forgotten.","ACD"
id4531,"There were also some tableaux in which Cynthia took part.","ACR"
id3096,"The man in the corner raised a meek voice.","ACR"
id1091,"It is very bewildering.","ACD"
id207,"I've had my eye on the Professor for some little time.","ACD"
id1010,"You say that before Sir       Charles Baskerville’s death several people saw this apparition       upon the moor?","ACD"
id3768,"I have not distinguished myself!","ACR"
id648,"It       may have been—yes, by Jove, it _is_ a curly-haired spaniel.","ACD"
id6617,"His manner became palpably anxious; and his choice of words was more carefully selected than ever.","WKL"
id4534,"Such a charming invitation from Mrs. Rolleston.","ACR"
id790,"Our visitor readjusted his glasses and began:          The recent sudden death of Sir Charles Baskerville, whose name         has been mentioned as the probable Liberal candidate for         Mid-Devon at the next election, has cast a gloom over the         county.","ACD"
id4352,"Why, Cynthia, you are late to-day.","ACR"
id258,"Challenger?","ACD"
id1554,"This was no mean den of cut-throats into which I had been carried, but it must be the hall of some Venetian palace.","ACD"
id4217,"I felt I had suddenly strayed into another world.","ACR"
id1601,"My jacket was torn, my hair was dishevelled, my head was bleeding, but there was that in my eyes and in my carriage which made them realise that no common man was before them.","ACD"
id3178,"cried Poirot.","ACR"
id6546,"If I see those gloomy faces any longer, as sure as my name’s Garth, I’ll give your mother written warning and go back to my friends by the mixed train at twelve forty.","WKL"
id5851,"Far more likely to suit my friend than any I have seen yet.","WKL"
id3817,"But why should he steal his own diamond?","ACR"
id6171,"Add to that, a man in ten thousand--and, for once, Report might claim to be right.","WKL"
id4082,"Poirot went out and accosted him and presently brought him up to the room we had engaged.","ACR"
id593,"It gives us the basis for several       deductions.","ACD"
id684,"Glad to meet you, sir.","ACD"
id2779,"They never seemed to read the papers or to care about what went on in the world.","ACR"
id203,"You may have better luck, or more tact in handling him.","ACD"
id924,"Sir Charles had evidently stood there       for five or ten minutes.","ACD"
id2139,"You will find it the most useful disguise.","ACD"
id995,"A devil with merely local powers like a parish vestry       would be too inconceivable a thing.","ACD"
id5456,"I have been through it all in my time, he said.","WKL"
id1680,"I had no time to peep through my hole of communication, for next moment my own door was flung open and my rascally gondolier, with the other assassins, came into the cell.","ACD"
id4851,"Tell her she is wanted directly.","WKL"
id6357,"she went on, taking the girl’s chin familiarly in her hand, with a half-satirical, half-fond attention which betrayed that the youngest daughter, with all her faults, was the governess’s favorite—Well?","WKL"
id4545,"Say something original, groaned Cynthia.","ACR"
id5463,"Mrs. Vanborough looked at her husband with unconcealed surprise and distress.","WKL"
id6174,"For three years nothing was known of him but that he was reading hard and keeping his terms.","WKL"
id2106,"My new comrades and my old, divided in all else, would still have a point of union in their love and admiration of Etienne Gerard.","ACD"
id2562,"Pamela was a magnificent young woman.","ACR"
id113,"I didn't know.","ACD"
id6392,"and the way she courtesied and courtesied, till she cheated the foolish people into crying encore?","WKL"
id2687,"But he was not a good man of business.","ACR"
id1244,"You have lost one of your boots?","ACD"
id1836,"Then he may have left the house as well.","ACD"
id6568,"Taking his portrait, from top to toe, the picture of him began with a tall hat, broadly encircled by a mourning band of crumpled crape.","WKL"
id3834,"Lord Yardly prepares to range himself—to settle down.","ACR"
id4843,"No answer being given, he opened the door and looked into the room.","WKL"
id3565,"I adore them, she said with a little catch in her voice.","ACR"
id2159,"I tied the girdle of my gown, and taking off my busby, I drew the cowl over my head.","ACD"
id4310,"Everyone is—usually something absurd.","ACR"
id4034,"He had a strong premonition of his own death.","ACR"
id850,"So excited and alarmed was he that I was compelled to go       down to the spot where the animal had been and look around for       it.","ACD"
id1252,"I put them both outside my door last       night, and there was only one in the morning.","ACD"
id92,"We can't all be Stanleys and Burtons, said I; besides, we don't get the chance,--at least, I never had the chance.","ACD"
id1110,"The man was elderly and infirm.","ACD"
id1136,"The address, Sir Henry       Baskerville, Northumberland Hotel, was printed in rough       characters; the post-mark Charing Cross, and the date of       posting the preceding evening.","ACD"
id1998,"Was it not natural that I should wish to tell these brave comrades what sort of man it was that had come among them?","ACD"
id4478,"And he’s a great friend of Mary’s, put in Cynthia, the irrepressible.","ACR"
id289,"He had a fearful row about it in Vienna, I believe.","ACD"
id4383,"She jumped up promptly, and something in her manner reminded me that her position was a dependent one, and that Mrs. Inglethorp, kind as she might be in the main, did not allow her to forget it.","ACR"
id6634,"Accept my best thanks.","WKL"
id5810,"He barely looked at her while she spoke.","WKL"
id3382,"Lady Yardly, I said, I know why you have come here.","ACR"
id2278,"Quick!","ACD"
id2282,"Listen to me!","ACD"
id5272,"still not seen by any eyes but mine!","WKL"
id3618,"There, just short of the threshold, lay the glittering necklace, evidently dropped by the thief in the panic of his flight.","ACR"
id5072,"'You must forgive him,' the clergyman said.","WKL"
id4148,"I began work with ‘Bernard’ which might have suggested the local doctor had he come across him at all.","ACR"
id2742,"She is certainly _very_ good-looking.","ACR"
id3968,"By the way, you saw no need for an autopsy?","ACR"
id2311,"The lantern had been left burning upon the table, and by its light I saw, as I came out from behind my curtain, that the unfortunate Hubert's head had fallen forward upon his chest and that he also was dead.","ACD"
id6512,"Norah, whose fondness for reading had passed into a family proverb, took up book after book from table and shelf, and laid them down again, in despair of fixing her attention.","WKL"
id2717,"I felt instinctively that Mr. Flemming’s ideas of something suitable and mine were likely to be widely divergent, but it was certainly not the moment to air my views.","ACR"
id2637,"Finally, the doctor called upon me, and after making various ridiculous excuses for failing to send in a proper bill, he hummed and hawed a good deal and suddenly suggested that I should marry him.","ACR"
id1171,"I don’t know much about the tariff and things of that kind,       said he, but it seems to me we’ve got a bit off the trail so far       as that note is concerned.","ACD"
id3218,"All these details passed rapidly through my mind as I joined with Poirot in greeting our fair client.","ACR"
id2369,"Madame Nadina accepted the tribute with the ease of long habit and passed on to her dressing-room, where bouquets were heaped carelessly everywhere, marvellous garments of futuristic design hung on pegs, and the air was hot and sweet with the scent of the massed blossoms and with more sophisticated perfumes and essences.","ACR"
id3655,"I must see him, I suppose.","ACR"
id2378,"And when the Count comes you may go.","ACR"
id2080,"They bowed in silence, and I thought that I could see from the expression of their faces that they had already begun to take a more just view of my character.","ACD"
id4884,"She stood a moment silent--her hand trembling while she held the candlestick, so that the extinguisher lying loose in it rattled incessantly--then thanked the servant for calling her.","WKL"
id4402,"The evening passed pleasantly enough; and I dreamed that night of that enigmatical woman, Mary Cavendish.","ACR"
id3084,"And no money.","ACR"
id2353,"A number of Spanish soldiers were lounging and smoking in the corridor, several of whom addressed me as I passed.","ACD"
id118,"What a prosaic motive!","ACD"
id6690,"Mrs. Vanstone began by referring to the long and intimate friendship which had existed between Miss Garth and herself.","WKL"
id6404,"She treats Mr. Vanstone as if he was a kind of younger brother of hers.","WKL"
id2580,"But we must start at once, he declared, as he rose to his feet at the conclusion of the meal.","ACR"
id1819,"Only over my dead body should they reach them.","ACD"
id4665,"It was a real old bust-up.","ACR"
id6012,"The high courage that had sustained her against outrage which had openly declared itself shrank under the sense of something coming which she had not foreseen.","WKL"
id6709,"Ere long, however, there rose obscurely on her mind a doubt which perplexed and distressed her.","WKL"
id4795,"Then it must be later than I thought.","ACR"
id4629,"You’re looking very tired.","ACR"
id400,"Even at his worst I can usually control him.","ACD"
